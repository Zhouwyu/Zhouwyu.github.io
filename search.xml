But Barbie’s film debut also comes in the context of a much longer and more tortuous journey with an existential question at its core: After all these years, does Barbie still matter? And if she does, then … why?</p><p>From the moment Barbara Millicent Roberts — Barbie — came on the scene in 1959, the doll was controversial. Male toy executives, conditioned to believe that little girls wanted to play with babies, were flummoxed by this representation of a fully grown woman. But little girls, as they do, understood. Barbie became a sensation. And then a lightning rod. Then a concern. For the past 64 years, Barbie has been at the center of countless debates about who women are, who they should be, how they look and what they want.</p><p>Barbie looms as simultaneously an unrealistically proportioned airhead and a striving Everywoman. Most of the time she can’t utter a word, yet she’s believed to speak for a critical mass of us. Perhaps that’s why the “Barbie” movie that finally exists is the only one that could exist: one that acknowledges and embraces that weirdness under the vigilant gaze of a corporate chaperone. The trailer’s tagline (“If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.”) is confirmation that Barbie is, in the most literal way, everyone’s business.</p><p>I get it. At 6 years old, I was offered a choice between two dolls for my birthday: the Bionic Woman or Barbie. I didn’t, in contemporary toy-representation parlance, see myself in Barbie; the Bionic Woman’s brown hair and jumpsuit much more accurately mirrored my ponytail and hand-me-down corduroy overalls. Barbie, with her white-blond cascade of flosslike hair and a plunge-necked pink dress, was nothing like any woman I’d ever seen. Wasn’t that the point?</p><p>I chose Barbie.</p><p>In my childhood, the doll was always there — perched on my dresser, toted along on car trips, surfing the waves of my bathtub on a tortoiseshell comb. She was more distant in my adulthood, as Barbie had become a subject of feminist concern. I followed many authors, artists, musicians and assorted culture jammers who were publicly working out their own Barbie issues in fascinating ways. Along the way, I realized this: Barbie is that childish thing none of us can put away, because as long as she’s existed, she’s never been a child. Rather, she’s been an emblem, a scapegoat, a lightning rod, a target and, most of all, a mirror. However we feel about Barbie at a given moment says a lot more about us than it does about Barbie.</p><p>When the 1980s backlash against women’s liberation bled into the ’90s, psychologists started raising the alarm over a crisis in girls’ confidence in best-selling books like “Reviving Ophelia.” Anita Hill was explaining sexual harassment to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and women on college campuses were reporting an alarming incidence of sexual assaults. A new wave of feminism was cresting, and it was dragging Barbie under. There was the matter of her unnatural proportions, like a waist-to-hip ratio that could not exist in real life without sacrificing key internal organs. Later, it was her inescapable blondness and whiteness. Despite introductions of Black and Latina Barbies in 1980, along with special collections like the 1980s’ Barbies of the World, everyone knew the real Barbie — the icon, the ur-Barbie, the one true Barbie — was a testament to the same Western beauty ideal inscribed into America’s other institutions of ornamental femininity, from Hollywood to Miss America to Playboy.</p><p>As with every iteration of feminism, those of us in the third wave that rose in the ’90s had to grapple with the missteps, misgivings and unfinished business of the previous generations. Barbie certainly wasn’t the most important issue, but she was, after all, right there, nakedly and even proudly what we would come to term problematic. So we donned our hot-pink hair shirts.</p><p>Barbie’s overlords were also being humbled. In 1992, Mattel introduced Teen Talk Barbie, which uttered, among other phrases, a chirpy “Math class is tough!” confirming that the historically trend-savvy brand was falling behind the times — and prompting criticism from the American Association of University Women. Mattel’s litigious responses to things like the 1998 intersectional feminist body-image essay collection “Adios, Barbie” and Aqua’s gratingly ubiquitous earworm “Barbie Girl” didn’t help its P.R. Mattel celebrated Barbie’s 40th birthday in 1999 with a brand overhaul that shifted focus from dolls to actual girls, debuting an ad campaign that exhorted its young audience to “become your own hero.”</p><p>The “Barbie” movie is also about becoming your own hero or at least taking a hero’s journey — one that leads Barbie into a real world that, for the most part, finds her either dangerous or irrelevant. It’s a fitting approach, since the most interesting thing about Barbie has always been our reactions to her. Some reviews have said the film suffers from an attempt by the director, Greta Gerwig, to incorporate the breadth of the Barbie discourse, causing a narrative overload. But how could it not, given just how much discourse Barbie has inspired over 64 years?</p><p>There’s a different film — the 2018 documentary “Tiny Shoulders: Rethinking Barbie” — that, for me, helps put that discourse in context. “Tiny Shoulders” chronicled Mattel as a company in crisis: Faced with shrinking revenues and declining audience interest, the company was poised in 2016 to introduce a collection of dolls whose skin tones and body types tick a few diversity boxes. I was interviewed for the film, alongside the Barbie historians M.G. Lord and Amanda Foreman and the feminist authors Roxane Gay (a contributing Opinion writer) and Gloria Steinem, with each of us offering context and commentary on Barbie’s place in the past, present and future of women’s lives.</p><p>I didn’t realize the film’s narrative would essentially serve as a Mattel redemption arc. When I saw the finished film, I realized that in the course of my life I had gone from a guileless Barbie consumer to an enlightened Barbie renouncer to an unwitting Barbie P.R. booster.</p><p>Yet for all the ways Barbie has evolved, so have our expectations for her. As Michelle Chidoni, Mattel’s P.R. chief (or, as she describes herself, “Barbie’s publicist”), said, inspiring the documentary’s title, Barbie holds the weight of several generations’ worth of beauty standards and feminist analysis on her tiny shoulders. Those shoulders might get the occasional refashioning — to make them more athletic or fleshier or more diverse in hue or, in the case of this new film, more self-aware of the weight they’ve been tasked with carrying — but that doesn’t change the fact that we keep adding standards for her to live up to. As a symbol, Barbie is so complicated as to be useless. But as a vessel, she’s proved remarkably durable.</p><p>I’m willing to acknowledge — even mock — my once-reflexive feminist rejection of everything Barbie: She never had to be a zero-sum figure, a thing you were either with or against. Many of us definitely saw her that way. That we did speaks only to the continuing challenges of a world that, even now, isn’t sure whether women can be free of stereotypes or expectations and be allowed to simply exist.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>culmination 结局；某事物的顶点（极点，最终成果）</p><p>languish 受苦，经历苦难，受煎熬</p><p>turnaround 突然）好转，改观，改善；（接活到交活之间的）周转期，时限，周转时间；根本性的变化，彻底的改变</p><p>big name 名人；重要人物；大名鼎鼎的</p><p>deep pockets （组织或人）财力雄厚</p><p>tortuous 弯弯曲曲的；曲折的；转弯抹角的</p><p>condition 训练；使习惯于；使适应；使（人或动物）形成条件反射</p><p>flummoxed 困惑的，迷惘的</p><p>sensation 轰动；哗然；引起轰动的人（或事物）；感觉；知觉</p><p>lightning rod 避雷针；替罪羊，代人受过者;引火烧身的人(或事)</p><p>loom （令人惊恐地）隐约显现；赫然耸现；（不希望或不愉快的事情）阴森地逼近</p><p>simultaneously 同时地</p><p>proportioned 成比例的，比例匀称的</p><p>Everywoman 普通女性；一般女人</p><p>utter 发出（声音）；说</p><p>vigilant 警觉的；警戒的；警惕的</p><p>trailer （电影或电视节目的）预告片</p><p>tagline 宣传词</p><p>literal （意义）字面的，根本的</p><p>parlance 说法，用语；术语</p><p>-necked 有…脖子的;是…衣领的</p><p>perch 坐在…（的边缘）上；栖息于；停留于</p><p>tote 携带，搬运，背负（尤指重物或不便之物）；大手提包，大手提袋</p><p>tortoiseshell 玳瑁壳，龟甲，龟板；仿玳瑁壳</p><p>assorted 各种各样的；混杂的；什锦的</p><p>emblem 象征；标志；符号；徽章</p><p>scapegoat 替罪羊，代人受过的人</p><p>backlash 强烈抵制，集体反对</p><p>revive （使）苏醒，复活；（使）复兴；（使）重新流行</p><p>ratio 比率；比例</p><p>icon 象征物；偶像；图标；图符</p><p>ur- 原来的;最早的</p><p>testament 证明；验证</p><p>inscribe 题写;刻，雕</p><p>ornamental  装饰性的，装饰用的；装饰的</p><p>femininity 女性；女子气质（尤指温柔、娇小和美丽）</p><p>iteration 反复（通常为了作出改善而重复做某事）；迭代，叠代（数学里若干次使用一个数学法则得出的量）</p><p>grapple with 扭打；搏斗；努力设法解决；尽力解决；设法对付；尽量克服</p><p>misgiving （对未来事件的）疑虑，担忧</p><p>don  穿戴上</p><p>overlord （尤指旧时的）领主，大王，霸主 </p><p>humble 谦虚的，谦逊的</p><p>chirpy   快活的；活泼的；轻松愉快的</p><p>savvy 常识；实际能力；有见识的；懂实际知识的；通情达理的</p><p>litigious 爱打官司的，好诉讼的</p><p>gratingly （声音）刺耳的</p><p>ubiquitous 无所不在的</p><p>earworm 常在耳边回响的歌曲；（因不断在脑中重复而恼人的）上口曲调</p><p>overhaul 彻底检修，大修；改造；改进</p><p>exhort 激励；规劝；敦促</p><p>discourse 论文；演讲；语篇；话语；对话；交流</p><p>narrative 故事；叙事；（对事件的特定的）陈述</p><p>chronicle 编年史；年代记；大事记；记述，记录（大事）；把…载入编年史；按发生时间顺序编写或播放</p><p>shrink （使）缩小，（使）变小</p><p>poised  平衡的；作好准备的，摆好姿势的</p><p>redemption （尤指基督教的）拯救，赎罪，救赎</p><p>arc 弧；弧状；弧线；弧形；情节（或主题）的发展</p><p>guileless 诚实无欺的，老实的</p><p>unwitting 不知情的；无意的</p><p>hue  颜色；色度；色调</p><p>zero-sum 一方得益一方受损的；得失所系的</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p>不怎么了解芭比所代表的含义，只觉得这篇文章真的是又长又难懂😭</p>]]></content>

How do you time 10 seconds? Who decides?” “White Lotus” actor Paolo Camili said in a comment to Fox News Digital. “Some think that it’s a very short time, that it’s nothing, that it happens by chance… If they stand there and count for themselves, they will realize that 10 seconds are really a long time.”</p><p>A judge ruled that 66-year-old Antonio Avola did not sexually harass a 17-year-old student at a Rome high school because the April 2022 incident happened too quickly, the BBC reported. </p><p>The student said she was walking up a staircase when a janitor pulled her trousers down and touched her buttocks and grabbed her underwear. A prosecutor asked for a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for the crime.</p><p>The janitor admitted to groping the student without consent but insisted it was a joke, and the judge acquitted the man and claimed the incident “did not constitute a crime,” shocking many of the country’s youth and drawing outrage. </p><p>The victim herself asked if the judge was “joking” with his decision, insisting the janitor “took” her from behind without saying anything. “This, at least for me, is not a joke,” she said, stressing that the ruling may in fact discourage women from reporting violence because they might worry it’s “not worth it.” </p><p>“Silence, in general, protects aggressors,” she said, hoping that the prosecutor’s office will appeal the ruling, according to Day Italia News. “I’m starting to think I was wrong to trust the institutions. This is not justice.” </p><p>Camili took to social media to express his anger over the “palpaga breve” — or “brief groping” — ruling, putting a timer over a video of himself feeling his own chest for 10 seconds before exploding in an angry rant. </p><p>He posted the video with the comment, “Lo Stato non dovrebbe proteggere?,” or “Shouldn’t the State protect?” </p><p>Other influencers followed, similarly posting videos of themselves either with a timer or counting to 10 on their fingers to show just how long a time that is. The posters remain silent and stare at the camera for the whole time, and mostly grope their own chests. </p><p>Activist Francesco Cicconetti posted his own video, writing, “Women’s bodies are not owned by men.

This is his guide to longevity."></a><strong>My father, Henry Kissinger, is turning 100. This is his guide to longevity.</strong></h1><hr><p>On Saturday, my father, Henry Kissinger, celebrates his 100th birthday. This might have an air of inevitability for anyone familiar with his force of character and love of historical symbolism. Not only has he outlived most of his peers, eminent detractors and students, but he has also remained indefatigably active throughout his 90s.</p><p>Even the pandemic did not slow him down: Since 2020, he has completed two books and begun work on a third. He returned from the Bilderberg Conference in Lisbon earlier this week just in time to embark on a series of centennial celebrations that will take him from New York to London and finally to his hometown of Fürth, Germany.</p><p>My father’s longevity is especially miraculous when one considers the health regimen he has followed throughout his adult life, which includes a diet heavy on bratwurst and Wiener schnitzel, a career of relentlessly stressful decision-making, and a love of sports purely as a spectator, never a participant.</p><p>How then to account for his enduring mental and physical vitality? He has an unquenchable curiosity that keeps him dynamically engaged with the world. His mind is a heat-seeking weapon that identifies and grapples with the existential challenges of the day. In the 1950s, the issue was the rise of nuclear weapons and their threat to humanity. About five years ago, as a promising young man of 95, my father became obsessed with the philosophical and practical implications of artificial intelligence.</p><p>As the Thanksgiving turkey was passed around in recent years, he would ruminate about the repercussions of this new technology, in ways that occasionally reminded his grandchildren of storylines in the Terminator films. While immersing himself in the technical aspects of AI with the intensity of an MIT grad student, he infused the debate over its uses with his singular philosophical and historical insight.</p><p>The other secret to my father’s endurance is his sense of mission. Although he has been caricatured as a cold realist, he is anything but dispassionate. He believes deeply in such arcane concepts as patriotism, loyalty and bipartisanship. It pains him to see the nastiness in today’s public discourse and the seeming collapse of the art of diplomacy.</p><p>As a child, I remember the warmth of his friendships with people whose politics might have been different from his, such as Kay Graham, Ted Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. Kennedy loved to play practical jokes that my father thoroughly enjoyed (including inviting Dad to his home office and claiming to have a mongoose hidden in a closet).</p><p>Even as Cold War tensions persisted, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin was a frequent guest at our house. The two of them would occasionally play games of chess between negotiating issues affecting the entire planet. My father had no illusions about the repressive nature of the Soviet regime, but these regular conversations helped de-escalate tensions at a time when the nuclear superpowers appeared to be on a collision course. If only such regular dialogue occurred between the top players in today’s global tensions.</p><p>Chess aside, diplomacy was never a game for my father. He practiced it with a commitment and tenacity born of personal experience. As a refugee from Nazi Germany, he had lost 13 family members and countless friends to the Holocaust. He returned to his native Germany as an American soldier, participating in the liberation of the Ahlem concentration camp near Hannover.

Much has been studied on the financial and professional hits women take when having a child, but new research that claims to have analyzed roughly 100 times the data that past studies have done on the topic hints at a main driving force behind the “motherhood penalty”— America’s cultural stereotypes regarding work and parenthood. </p><p>Douglas Almond, Yi Cheng, and Cecilia Machado examined more than 800,000 earnings reports from the U.S. unemployment insurance program during 1990 to 2010 to find how much women actually lose when they become mothers, examining different scenarios in which the motherhood penalty might be smaller. They called what they found “discouraging:” It hits all mothers in America, regardless of their pay, company, or education. </p><p>And it happens almost instantaneously: Whereas the arrival of a firstborn child doesn’t have any effect on a man’s earnings, moms experience a 51% dock in pay, equivalent to an average of $8,000 annually. The motherhood penalty only persisted as the child aged; researchers found that six years after the first child’s birth, the pay gap between father and mother increased slightly. </p><p>It didn’t matter if the mother worked for a woman or at a mostly woman-dominant firm. It also didn’t matter the size of the company the mother worked for. Or if she went to college. And it didn’t matter if the mother also happened to be the breadwinner in the family.</p><p>“What’s striking about the U.S. motherhood penalty is how universal it seems,” Almond tells Fortune. “Even when the female partner outearns her male partner and we might expect the lower-paid dad to ‘step up’ at home, we find a still larger motherhood penalty: around 60% of earnings.”</p><p>In Sweden, by contrast, Almond says there is no motherhood penalty when the woman outearns her male partner. “The Swedish pattern makes more economic sense—the man likely has a lower opportunity cost,” he added, referring to the country’s different cultural expectations. </p><p>“There is a culture of U.S. dads not contributing as much childcare as in other countries,” he said, pointing to his own experience as a father. While based in New York City, his wife is Swedish and their daughters have dual citizenship in the two countries. He said he was “always struck by how few dads were at playgrounds in New York City” and the assumption that he was just “filling in.” The difference is visible in Stockholm, he said, where “you see as many dads as moms caring for their children.”</p><p>It’s this American stereotype—that child-rearing should fall on the mother—that leads to some mothers dropping out of the workforce altogether, contributing to the gap in earnings, while those who remain experience an earnings dip regardless. The effects plague women throughout their careers and beyond.</p><p>A Harvard study found that mothers are often less likely to be hired and then usually offered lower salaries than women without children. And a survey from TIAA finds that they have almost 30% less saved for retirement than men on average, in part due to choices regarding taking care of or providing for their children.</p><p>America’s workforce continues to fail when it comes to supporting working moms, Pam Cohen, Ph.D., chief research and analytics officer at the Mom Project, told Fortune’s Ivana Pino. “The need for support extends well beyond the limited early stages of parenthood and yet tends to drop off precipitously beyond that point in time at which mothers return from parental leave,” she said. </p><p>It doesn’t help that it’s become extremely difficult to find affordable childcare. It’s become so expensive that families spend almost a third of their household income on it. “The shortcomings of the child care system disproportionately affect the financial well-being of women, single parents, parents in poverty, families of color and immigrant families,” reads the Annie E. Casey Foundation in its KIDS COUNT Data Book, pointing to research from 2022 that showed how women were five to eight times more likely to have their careers be affected by caregiving duties in 2022. </p><p>More affordable childcare has long been touted as a solution to the motherhood penalty in America. But that’s only half the battle. Almond believes the solution begins with changing the culture that is rooted in sexism and the way we view the roles of mother and father. “Culture can and does change,” he said.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>Motherhood penalty 指的是女性在成为母亲后可能在职场上面临的一系列负面影响，包括但不限于薪资减少、职业晋升机会减少、职业成就受限等。这种现象主要是由于社会对母亲角色的刻板印象和性别偏见，以及对母亲的特殊需求（如育儿假）的处理不当</p><p>put your money where your mouth is  以实际行动支持，以行动证明自己的话</p><p>hint 暗示，示意</p><p>scenario 场景；设想；可能的情况；可能发生的事态</p><p>discouraging 令人沮丧的</p><p>instantaneously 瞬间地，即刻地</p><p>dock （使宇宙飞船在外层空间）对接；克扣，扣发（尤指金钱）</p><p>persist 继续存在（发生）；坚持；执意</p><p>breadwinner 养家糊口的人</p><p>striking  异乎寻常的，惊人的；引人注目的；显著的；不同寻常的；俊秀的；妩媚动人的；很有魅力的</p><p>universal 普遍的；全体的；共同的</p><p>outearn 收入更多，收入超过</p><p>fill in 代替;临时补缺</p><p>dip （通常指暂时的）减少，下降，衰退</p><p>plague 瘟疫，疫病；不断困扰，折磨，使苦恼</p><p>drop off 减少，下降；入睡</p><p>precipitously 陡然地，险峻地</p><p>parental leave 亲子假，育儿假</p><p>disproportionately 不成比例地；不相称地；太大（或太小）地</p><p>read 写着，写的是；显示</p><p>tout 标榜；吹捧；吹嘘</p><p>be half the battle 成功了一半；完成最困难的部分</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Their communication skills lag behind those of their predecessors.</p><p>These are the intriguing findings of a study – carried out by researchers based at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) – which examined what life was like for babies born during the pandemic, and the implications for their health and development.</p><p>The study – carried out by a team led by Susan Byrne, senior lecturer at the RCSI, and Jonathan Hourihane, the RCSI’s professor of paediatrics – focused on babies born in the first three months of lockdown and compared them with a similar group of babies born before the pandemic. A total of 354 families and their babies were involved in the study.</p><p>“We wanted to understand what life was like for babies born during the pandemic, and what it might mean for their general health and development,” Byrne told the Observer.</p><p>The team’s discoveries were striking. They found that, at six months, an average of only three people had kissed babies, including their parents – indicating babies had met very few relatives or family friends. One in four babies had not met another child their own age by their first birthday, it was also revealed.</p><p>Byrne added that when parents were asked what it felt like to raise a child during lockdown they frequently used words such as “lonely” and “isolating”. On the other hand, it was also found that family time and bonding expanded.</p><p>Babies born during the pandemic probably heard fewer words because they were not getting out of their houses, and this may have led to their slightly lower communication scores compared with those of children born earlier.</p><p>However, for other attributes – such as motor skills and problem-solving ability – no overall drop in performance was recorded. In addition, questionnaires filled in by parents revealed no differences in their children’s behaviour with regard to sleep problems, anxiety or social withdrawal.</p><p>Now the group is hoping to extend the study and follow babies until they start school at the age of five. “That is going to be really important,” Byrne told the Observer.</p><p>“Covid restrictions ended quite a while ago, and babies have been out and about doing normal activities, meeting other people, going to play groups. And you’d hope that the findings would settle by the age of five – but we need to find out conclusively if that is really the case.”</p><p>The relatively encouraging conclusions of the Irish study contrast with the academic performances of older children.</p><p>Last week it was revealed that primary school pupils in England were still doing worse in mathematics and writing compared with standards that were established before the pandemic forced school closures. Reading performance was also found to have stalled.</p><p>Standard assessment tests (Sats), taken in England at the end of primary school, showed a slight improvement on last year but results remained far behind 2019, according to figures released last week. Tests were not taken in 2020 and 2021 because of Covid disruption.</p><p>Fewer than three-fifths of pupils are reaching the expected standard in the key subjects of reading, writing and maths, it was found. This year’s figure of 59% is down from 65% before lockdown and is considerably lower than the government’s target of 90% of pupils meeting the expected standard in all three disciplines at key stage 2 by 2030.</p><p>Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The results confirm the point made by teachers and researchers: primary schools are still deeply affected by the pandemic, and Sats worsen this already difficult situation. Funding is inadequate.</p><p>“Class sizes are growing. The jobs of support staff have been cut. There is no substantial programme to support educational recovery.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>exception 例外</p><p>lag 缓慢移动；掉队，滞后</p><p>predecessor 前任，前辈；原有事物，前身</p><p>intriguing 非常有趣的；引人入胜的；神秘的</p><p>surgeon 外科医生</p><p>implication 可能的影响（或作用、结果）；含意；暗指，暗示</p><p>paediatrics 儿科学</p><p>lockdown 封锁</p><p>striking 异乎寻常的，惊人的；引人注目的；显著的；不同寻常的</p><p>bonding 人与人之间的关系（或联结）；亲密关系的形成</p><p>withdrawl 沉默寡言；孤僻；收回；不再参加；退出（组织）；撤军</p><p>contrast   对比</p><p>stall 推迟，暂缓；搁置；停止进展；货摊，摊位；售货亭</p><p>discipline 知识领域；（尤指大学的）学科，科目，专业；惩罚，惩罚；训练，教导；自我控制；严格要求（自己）</p><p>substantial 大的；可观的；价值巨大的；重大的；基本上的；大体上的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

They found that more emojis were used between closer friends, that using positive emojis to express positive feelings correlated with personal wellbeing, and that positive emojis could be used to mask the expression of negative feelings.</p><p>Have you ever received an unwanted gift and still said ‘thank you’? This choice to hide a negative emotion is a display rule. Although display rules can promote interpersonal harmony, they can also have negative consequences for the person choosing to change how they express emotions. As more social interaction goes online, scientists are investigating how emojis are used to reflect our emotions in different contexts. Are there display rules that apply to emojis, and how do those affect people’s wellbeing?</p><p>“As online socializing becomes more prevalent, people have become accustomed to embellishing their expressions and scrutinizing the appropriateness of their communication,” said Moyu Liu of the University of Tokyo, who investigated this question in a study published in Frontiers in Psychology. “However, I realized that this may lead us to lose touch with our authentic emotions.”</p><p>Emojis and emotions</p><p>Liu recruited 1,289 participants, all users of the most-downloaded emoji keyboard in Japan, Simeji, to investigate how emojis were used to express or mask emotions. Previous research had established that people use emojis as functional equivalents of facial expressions, but not the relationships between emotions expressed and experienced. This is when display rules can prove problematic: if the dissonance between the emotions that you experience and the emotions that you can express is too great, emotional exhaustion can develop, although members of different cultures experience this differently.</p><p>Display rules impact more on negative emotions, which it is usually considered less appropriate to express. It is also often more acceptable to express emotions to someone who is closer to you, and it can be more acceptable for a particular gender to express particular emotions. It can also be considered more acceptable to express negative emotions in more individualist societies.</p><p>Wearing your heart on your screen</p><p>The participants in Liu’s study provided demographic data, answered questions about their subjective wellbeing, and rated how often they use emojis. They were given messages with varying social contexts, responded to them as they would normally, and rated the intensity of the expression of their emotions.</p><p>Liu found that people chose to express more emotions with emojis in private contexts or with close friends. Respondents expressed least emotion towards higher-status individuals. Intense expressions of emotion came with matching emojis, unless people felt the need to mask their true emotions: for instance, using smiling emojis to mask negative emotions. Negative emojis were used only where negative feelings were very strongly felt. Expressing emotions with emojis was associated with higher subjective wellbeing compared to masking emotions.</p><p>“With online socializing becoming ever more prevalent, it is important to consider whether it is causing us to become more detached from our true emotions,” said Liu. “Do people require a ‘shelter’ to express their genuine emotions, and is it possible to break free from pretense and share our true selves in online settings?”</p><p>Liu emphasized that the study should be expanded in the future. The Simeji keyboard is extremely popular among young women, which skewed the sample towards women and generation Z. However, this also reflected the gender imbalance in use of emojis in general and the Simeji keyboard in particular. A broader pool of participants would provide a fuller picture of the display rules around emojis.</p><p>“First, the highly gender-imbalanced sample may have led to stronger results. Future research should explore potential gender differences in emoji display rules and examine the structural issues surrounding the formation of these emotion cultures,” cautioned Liu. “Second, Japanese culture’s emphasis on interpersonal harmony and concealment of negative emotions may have influenced the results.”</p><p>“I would welcome the opportunity to expand this study and investigate the display rules for emojis across different genders and cultures,” added Liu. “Collaboration with scholars from diverse cultural backgrounds would be invaluable in this endeavor, and I am open to any contact.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>correlate 相关，联系</p><p>mask 口罩，掩盖</p><p>interpersonal 人际的</p><p>harmony 和谐</p><p>embellish 装饰，修饰；给…添枝加叶，渲染</p><p>equivalent （价值、数量、意义、重要性等）相等的，相同的；相等的东西；等量；对应词</p><p>dissonance 不和谐音；分歧，异议</p><p>wear your heart on your sleeve 表达真心</p><p>demographic 人口的；人口统计的；人口学的</p><p>subjective 主观的</p><p>respondent 回答者；答复者；应答者</p><p>detached  分离的，分开的；拆下的；认为与己无关的；毫不关心的，心不在焉的</p><p>shelter 掩蔽（处）;遮蔽（处）</p><p>genuine 真正的；非伪造的；名副其实的；真诚的；诚实的；真心的</p><p>pretense 妄称；自称；标榜</p><p>skew 歪曲；曲解；使不公允；影响…的准确性</p><p>sample （用于检验、分析的）样本，试样</p><p>concealment 隐藏；隐匿；隐瞒</p></blockquote>]]></content>

You reply instantly because that’s what you always do.</p><p>Then you decide to add another message: “By the way, I love you ☺”</p><p>You see the “read” status appear under the message, and you wait for his or her reply. An hour later you are still waiting, still checking.</p><p>Has this ever happened to you?</p><p>For most of us, there is an unwritten social contract that underlies our online messaging interactions. The clearest part of that contract is that certain types of messages demand a timely response.</p><p>In our world of instant communications, it seems we have come to expect that the general immediacy and access to information afforded to us by our technology, should be reflected in our online social communication, just as it would be when face-to-face.</p><p>But norms that exist in the real world don’t necessarily transfer easily to the digital realm. Is it time we developed a new social contract for online communications?</p><p>Stoking the fires of social anxiety</p><p>When the social contract is broken or even bent a little, it can introduce a hierarchy of discomfort into the communication process, often including anxiety and introspective rumination over the reasons for the non-reply.</p><p>These types of emotions may be felt much more powerfully when we believe the person on the other end has actually read our message but has chosen to ignore us.</p><p>In these cases, our discomfort may rise with the passing of time. The rising anxiety may escalate to the point where we bombard the non-replier with yet more messages to try to elicit a response.</p><p>Of course, responses such as these can vary from person to person, and culture to culture. It has been suggested some people who are highly emotionally reactive and use text messaging excessively may actually feel rejected, isolated and suffer deep anxiety when replies to their messages are not immediate.</p><p>Read receipts makes things worse</p><p>It’s worth considering that the technology platform we use to conduct our messaging activities, may contribute to our expectations of an immediate reply.</p><p>Virtually every online messaging platform has a way of informing us when our message has been delivered to, and read by, the recipient.</p><p>WhatsApp has two blue ticks, one for successful delivery and one for when the message has been read. Facebook messenger shows the recipient’s profile picture beside the message, and so on.</p><p>If we know the person well, we may even know they have message receipt notifications set to appear on their device. These notifications do not specifically trigger the read-receipt for our message, but we know it’s likely the recipient has at least seen our message.</p><p>Combine all this with the ability to see when someone was last active online, and you have the perfect reply-status nightmare, if you are someone who cares.</p><p>The fear of being ghosted</p><p>It’s easy to understand how read-receipt anxiety has evolved. Just imagine the offline equivalent – you say something to someone, you know they have heard you, but they deliberately ignore you.</p><p>When face to face, we would almost always make further enquiries to get our response and we’d be confused, or angry if it was not forthcoming.</p><p>It’s really not very surprising, given the very high volume of online messaging we now engage in, that people expect the same communication etiquette when using messaging platforms.</p><p>When non-reply behaviour is taken to an extreme, it may be analogous to a phenomenon known as ghosting. Ghosting involves indulging in behaviours such as not returning text messages, emails, phone calls or any related electronic communications.</p><p>It can occur within any type of close relationship but is more often associated with intimate ones. People often use ghosting as way of breaking off a relationship without any apparent justification.</p><p>Most of us would agree that a non-reply to an online message of love to an intimate other elicits a very strong emotional response, one that has very little to do with the length of the relationship in question.</p><p>In any intimate relationship, a non-reply may make us feel humiliated, rejected, isolated and embarrassed. Over time our anxiety will increase until we hear that return chime – hopefully they love us too, along with an apology for the delay, and all emotions can return quickly to normal levels.</p><p>Some people may actually use non-reply behaviour to manage their relationship dynamics, and torture their friends and loved ones. Of course no one reading this would ever have engaged in such Machiavellian behaviour!</p><p>Perhaps we need a new type of online communication social contract, and let’s set these expectations at the beginning of a relationship, or any friendship.</p><p>For example, on Tinder, profiles should perhaps have a box to tick to specify whether immediate replies are optional. Thanks to read-receipts and their associated emotional impact, relationship communication really has never been more complex and perplexing.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>chime 敲，鸣，响</p><p>contract 合同，契约；染重病；收缩，缩小</p><p>underlie 是···的深层原因，对···有重大影响</p><p>immediacy 即时性，直接性</p><p>realm 领域，王国</p><p>stoke 给···添柴火；煽动，激起</p><p>introspective 自省的，反省的</p><p>rumination 沉思，长时间思考</p><p>elicit 探出，引出</p><p>recipient 接收者，承受者</p><p>unwritten 不成文的</p><p>tick 滴答声；进展，进步；勾号</p><p>equivalent 相等的，相同的；等同。等量</p><p>etiquette 礼仪，礼节</p><p>analogous 相似的，类似的</p><p>justification 正当理由</p><p>humiliate 羞辱，使丢脸</p><p>torture 折磨，煎熬</p><p>Machiavellian  马基雅弗利式的，为夺取权力而不择手段的</p><p>specify 具体说明，明确指出</p><p>perplexing 令人困惑的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Citing “limited evidence” for carcinogenicity in humans, IARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B) and JECFA reaffirmed the acceptable daily intake of 40 mg&#x2F;kg body weight.</p><p>Aspartame is an artificial (chemical) sweetener widely used in various food and beverage products since the 1980s, including diet drinks, chewing gum, gelatin, ice cream, dairy products such as yogurt, breakfast cereal, toothpaste and medications such as cough drops and chewable vitamins.</p><p>“Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Every year, 1 in 6 people die from cancer. Science is continuously expanding to assess the possible initiating or facilitating factors of cancer, in the hope of reducing these numbers and the human toll,” said Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, WHO. “The assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.”</p><p>The two bodies conducted independent but complementary reviews to assess the potential carcinogenic hazard and other health risks associated with aspartame consumption. This was the first time that IARC has evaluated aspartame and the third time for JECFA.</p><p>After reviewing the available scientific literature, both evaluations noted limitations in the available evidence for cancer (and other health effects).</p><p>IARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) on the basis of limited evidence for cancer in humans (specifically, for hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a type of liver cancer). There was also limited evidence for cancer in experimental animals and limited evidence related to the possible mechanisms for causing cancer.</p><p>JECFA concluded that the data evaluated indicated no sufficient reason to change the previously established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–40 mg&#x2F;kg body weight for aspartame. The committee therefore reaffirmed that it is safe for a person to consume within this limit per day. For example, with a can of diet soft drink containing 200 or 300 mg of aspartame, an adult weighing 70kg would need to consume more than 9–14 cans per day to exceed the acceptable daily intake, assuming no other intake from other food sources.</p><p>IARC’s hazard identifications are the first fundamental step to understand the carcinogenicity of an agent by identifying its specific properties and its potential to cause harm, i.e. cancer. IARC classifications reflect the strength of scientific evidence as to whether an agent can cause cancer in humans, but they do not reflect the risk of developing cancer at a given exposure level. The IARC hazard evaluation considers all types of exposures (e.g. dietary, occupational). The strength-of-evidence classification in Group 2B is the third highest level out of 4 levels, and it is generally used either when there is limited, but not convincing, evidence for cancer in humans or convincing evidence for cancer in experimental animals, but not both.</p><p>“The findings of limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and animals, and of limited mechanistic evidence on how carcinogenicity may occur, underscore the need for more research to refine our understanding on whether consumption of aspartame poses a carcinogenic hazard,” said Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan of the IARC Monographs programme.</p><p>JECFA’s risk assessments determine the probability of a specific type of harm, i.e. cancer, to occur under certain conditions and levels of exposure. It is not unusual for JECFA to factor IARC classifications into its deliberations.</p><p>“JECFA also considered the evidence on cancer risk, in animal and human studies, and concluded that the evidence of an association between aspartame consumption and cancer in humans is not convincing,” said Dr Moez Sanaa, WHO’s Head of the Standards and Scientific Advice on Food and Nutrition Unit. “We need better studies with longer follow-up and repeated dietary questionnaires in existing cohorts. We need randomized controlled trials, including studies of mechanistic pathways relevant to insulin regulation, metabolic syndrome and diabetes, particularly as related to carcinogenicity.”</p><p>The IARC and JECFA evaluations of the impact of aspartame were based on scientific data collected from a range of sources, including peer-reviewed papers, governmental reports and studies conducted for regulatory purposes. The studies have been reviewed by independent experts, and both committees have taken steps to ensure the independence and reliability of their evaluations.</p><p>IARC and WHO will continue to monitor new evidence and encourage independent research groups to develop further studies on the potential association between aspartame exposure and consumer health effects.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>sweetener 甜味剂</p><p>additive 添加剂</p><p>carcinogenicity 致癌性</p><p>classify 分类</p><p>reaffirm 再次声明，重申，加强</p><p>intake 摄入量</p><p>gelatin 明胶，骨胶，动物胶</p><p>yogurt  酸奶</p><p>cereal 谷类食物</p><p>cough drop 止咳药</p><p>vitamin 维他命</p><p>facilitate 促进，促使</p><p>toll 伤亡，损失，破坏；收费，通行费</p><p>dose 一剂，一些</p><p>hazard 危害，风险</p><p>complementary 补充的，互补的</p><p>literature 文献，文献资料；文学，文学作品</p><p>exceed 超出，超过</p><p>identify 认出，识别，确定，发现</p><p>specific 明确的，具体的，确切的；特定的，特有的</p><p>property 属性，性能，特性</p><p>i.e. 也就是</p><p>mechanistic 僵化的，机械论的</p><p>underscore 强调，突出显示</p><p>refine 改善，改进，完善；精炼，提纯</p><p>deliberation 考虑，商议，细想</p><p>follow-up 后续行动，后续事物；后续的</p><p>cohort 有共同特点的一群人</p><p>insulin 胰岛素</p><p>metabolic 新陈代谢的</p><p>syndrome 综合征</p><p>diabetes 糖尿病</p><p>peer-review 同行评审</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Rego, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and chief of psychology and director of psychology training at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.</p><p>However, balance is important for well-being, he said. Spending too much time lying in bed can disrupt your mood and increase stress, said Rego, who is also director of the CBT Training Program at Montefiore.</p><p>“Be mindful and avoid overdoing it, no matter how good it may feel in the moment,” he said.</p><p>Lounging in bed for more than a day or two is concerning and could point to different mental health issues, Gold said.</p><p>“The urge to rot in bed all day, especially if it happens more and more, is likely about something more than just catching up on sleep or needing a day to do nothing, but avoiding the feelings, stress or pain of being awake,” she said.</p><p>This sort of behavior has been linked to symptoms of depression and anxiety, among other mental health illnesses, Gold added.</p><p>Your sleep hygiene may be at risk</p><p>Bed rotting could be affecting more than just your mental health — it could also have a negative impact on your sleep.</p><p>From a sleep science perspective, “bed rotting is exactly the opposite of what we want people to do,” said Kelly Glazer Baron, associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.</p><p>The bed should only be used for sleep, not for activities such as watching television, working or eating, she said.</p><p>As a general guideline, if you are not asleep within 30 minutes of getting into bed or are awake for more than 20 minutes during the night, you should get out of bed, Baron said.</p><p>If you want to relax somewhere comfortable, opt for a couch or comfy chair, she recommended.</p><p>“Having fatigue after a long day is normal, but if it is interfering with your work, social life or other important activities, then it is a good idea to discuss your symptoms with a doctor,” she said.</p><p>Activities beyond bed rotting</p><p>Bed rotting can allow you to isolate yourself, ignore your feelings, and possibly prevent you from participating in self-care activities that can help you, Gold said.</p><p>Recharging activities can energize us and “better prepare us for the inevitable stressors we face daily,” Rego said.</p><p>But don’t feel pressured to participate in an activity that someone else finds relaxing, he said, because one person’s “activity may be a chore to another.” Instead, learn coping skills that you want to do and think of them like hobbies, Gold said.</p><p>Some options include hanging out with a friend, exercising or practicing mindfulness, she said.</p><p>If you don’t want to leave the house, try reading a book or journaling instead of watching television, Gold said.</p><p>It may also be beneficial to talk to a therapist, she said. Therapy can help you learn new coping skills, get to the root cause of your bed rotting and determine if there is some mental health issue going on, Gold said.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>shift 轮班</p><p>burned out 极度劳累，疲劳过度</p><p>succumb 屈服，屈从；病死，生病</p><p>rot 腐烂，腐败</p><p>weigh in 在讨论或辩论中发表有分量的意见，发挥作用</p><p>tuck 塞进；把···夹入，把···藏入；使蜷缩</p><p>psychiatry 精神病学</p><p>coping 应对难题，处理麻烦</p><p>immobile 静止的，无法移动的</p><p>glance 瞥见</p><p>lounge 懒洋洋地坐着，懒散地躺着，休息厅，等候室；客厅，起居室</p><p>hygiene 卫生</p><p>perspective 观点，想法</p><p>associate professor 副教授</p><p>fatigue 疲劳</p><p>couch 沙发</p><p>comfy 舒适的</p><p>energize 使精力充沛，激励，激发</p><p>chore 日常琐事，杂务，乏味的例行工作</p><p>hang out 闲逛，经常出入某场所，与某人厮混</p><p>mindfulness 正念认知</p></blockquote>]]></content>

He was 94.</p><p>“Milan Kundera, a Czech-French author who is among the world’s most translated authors, died on July 11, 2023 in his Paris apartment,” the library, a state-funded research organization, said in a statement.</p><p>The author of “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” Kundera was known for his witty, tragicomic tales, which were often intertwined with deep philosophical debates and satirical portrayals of life under communist oppression.</p><p>Born in April 1929 in Brno, Czechoslovakia, Kundera was part of an influential generation of Czech writers, film makers and intellectuals who came of age during the turbulent post-World War II years.</p><p>As a successful writer and a sought-after academic, he became an influential critical voice within the party during the period of liberalization in the late 1960s that became known as the Prague Spring. It was during this era that his first novel, “The Joke,” was published.</p><p>That book – a deeply satirical look at revenge set in the totalitarian country – became a bestseller at home and around the world. And it was this book, and Kundera’s activities during the Prague Spring, that later cost him nearly everything he held dear.</p><p>Exile in Paris</p><p>He spent the rest of his life in exile in Paris, becoming a French citizen in 1981.</p><p>It was in Paris that Kundera’s literary career truly blossomed, with the publication of his three most acclaimed works, “The Book of Laughter and Forgetting,” “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” and “Immortality.”</p><p>A believer in the power of the novel, a genre he said should be recognized as its own art form, Kundera gradually became more and more protective of his work.</p><p>He scrutinized translations of his work and banned all adaptation of his books following the 1988 film based on “The Unbearable Lightness of Being.” Kundera served as a consultant on the movie, starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette Binoche, but later said the picture had little in common with the spirit of the book.  </p><p>“Immortality” was the last novel he wrote in his native Czech language before switching to French – a move that underlined Kundera’s complicated relationship with his homeland following his exile.</p><p>He returned rarely and when he did, he traveled incognito, booking into hotels under a pseudonym. While his Czech citizenship was restored in 2019, he was by then a French author whose home was in France.</p><p>Kundera always rejected the idea that his work was inspired by his own life experiences, a claim that was heavily scrutinized in 2008 when the Czech weekly newspaper Respekt published an article accusing the acclaimed author of acting as a communist police informant in 1950.</p><p>Kundera, having spent more than two decades living in seclusion and declining to do interviews, took the unusual step of speaking up. He strongly denied the accusation, calling it “the assassination of an author.”</p><p>He was defended by many high-profile Czech and international writers, including the former Czech President and playwright Vaclav Havel.</p><p>Nonetheless, the episode left an uncomfortable question mark over the true inspiration for some of Kundera’s most acclaimed novels, many of which revolve around the themes of disillusionment, responsibility, guilt and denunciation.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>Czech 捷克的</p><p>seclusion 隐居，与世隔绝，退隐</p><p>witty 风趣的，诙谐的，巧妙的，机智的</p><p>tragicomic 悲喜剧的</p><p>tale 历险记，故事</p><p>intertwine 交织，缠结</p><p>satirical 讽刺的，讥讽的</p><p>intellectual 知识分子，脑力劳动者</p><p>turbulent 动荡的，骚乱的</p><p>sought-after 广受欢迎的，热门的</p><p>revenge 复仇</p><p>acclaimed 广受欢迎的，备受推崇的</p><p>immortality 不朽，永生</p><p>genre 体裁，类型，风格</p><p>scrutinize 仔细检查</p><p>underline 下划线，强调</p><p>incognito 隐姓埋名地</p><p>pseudonym 假名，笔名</p><p>informant 线人，告密者，举报者</p><p>assassination 暗杀</p><p>high-profile 惹人注目，高姿态</p><p>playwright 剧作家</p><p>episode 一节，片段，一集</p><p>a question mark over sth 有关···的不确定性</p><p>revolve 旋转，转动，围绕</p><p>disillusionment 幻想破灭，醒悟</p><p>denunciation 谴责，公开批评；检举，告发</p></blockquote>]]></content>

It tends to hit even harder when you actually replay that game after ten, twenty, or even thirty years.</p><p>Today, a study was published by the Video Game History Foundation, and it offers up a damning revelation for fans of the retro world of gaming. In this study, it’s stated that 87% of classic video games released in the United States are ‘critically endangered’. And it suggests that as time goes on, it’s only going to get worse.</p><p>9 in 10 Games Are Gone</p><p>In the in-depth study that was published in partnership with the Software Preservation Network, it was revealed that just 13% of all games released before 2010 are commercially or readily available today. This study was completed using a random list of 1,500 games from a ‘single source of truth’, and during the data collection phase, analysts looked across multiple ecosystems of gaming, which they categorised as ‘abandoned’, ‘neglected’, and ‘active’.</p><p>However, that number quickly rose, and by the conclusion of the study, more than 4,000 games had been examined for signs of life and availability.

It’s the latest in a series of climate-change extremes that alarm but don’t surprise scientists.</p><p>The globe’s average temperature reached 62.9 degrees Fahrenheit (17.18 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, a common tool based on satellite data, observations, and computer simulations and used by climate scientists for a glimpse of the world’s condition. On Monday, the average temperature was 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit (17.01 degrees Celsius), setting a record that lasted only 24 hours.</p><p>While the figures are not an official government record, “this is showing us an indication of where we are right now,” said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Sarah Kapnick.</p><p>Even though the dataset used for the unofficial record goes back only to 1979, Kapnick said that given other data, the world is likely seeing the hottest day in “several hundred years that we’ve experienced.”</p><p>“A record like this is another piece of evidence for the now massively supported proposition that global warming is pushing us into a hotter future,” said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field, who was not part of the calculations.</p><p>With many places seeing temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), the new average temperatures might not seem very hot. But Tuesday’s global high was nearly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (a full degree Celsius) higher than the 1979-2000 average, which already tops the 20th- and 19th-century averages.</p><p>“People aren’t used to that. Their bodies aren’t used to that,” said Erinanne Saffell, Arizona’s state climatologist and an expert in extreme weather and climate events. “That’s important to understand who might be at risk, making sure people are hydrated, they’re staying cool, and they’re not exerting themselves outside, and taking care of those folks around you who might be at risk.”</p><p>The highs come after months of “truly unreal meteorology and climate stats for the year,” such as off-the-chart record warmth in the North Atlantic, record low sea ice in Antarctica and a rapidly strengthening El Nino, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado.</p><p>Scientists generally use much longer measurements — months, years, decades — to track the Earth’s warming. But the daily highs are an indication that climate change is reaching uncharted territory.</p><p>High-temperature records were surpassed this week in Quebec and Peru. Beijing reported nine straight days last week when the temperature exceeded 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). Cities across the U.S. from Medford, Oregon, to Tampa, Florida, have been hovering at all-time highs, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Wednesday may bring another unofficial record, with the Climate Reanalyzer again forecasting record or near-record heat. Antarctica’s average forecast for Wednesday is a whopping 4.5 degrees Celsius (8.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1979-2000 average.</p><p>In the U.S., heat advisories include portions of western Oregon, inland far northern California, central New Mexico, Texas, Florida and the coastal Carolinas, according to the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center. Excessive heat warnings are continuing across southern Arizona and California.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>spike 峰值；激增</p><p>straight 直的；连续的，不间断的</p><p>proposition 提议，建议；主张，观点，看法，见解</p><p>climatologist 气候学家</p><p>hydrated 摄入足够水分的</p><p>dehydrated 脱水的，极度干渴的</p><p>exert 运用，行使，施加</p><p>meteorology 气象学</p><p>stats 统计数字，统计信息</p><p>off the charts 处于极高水平的；非常受欢迎的，极成功的</p><p>uncharted 未知的，全新的，无人涉足的</p><p>territory  领域，领土，领地，活动范围</p><p>hover 盘旋，翱翔，徘徊，守候</p><p>whopping 庞大的，巨大的</p><p>advisory 给予意见的，报告，公告，警告</p></blockquote>]]></content>

McDonald’s is offering couples a $200 wedding package that includes 100 servings of chicken nuggets"></a><strong>Bride on a budget? McDonald’s is offering couples a $200 wedding package that includes 100 servings of chicken nuggets</strong></h1><hr><p>Getting married isn’t cheap and thanks to spiraling inflation, American couples are spending more than ever on their big day. The problem isn’t unique to the U.S., with wedding costs surging all over the world—and in one market, McDonald’s is stepping in to help.</p><p>The fast food giant’s Indonesian arm is offering a new “Wedding Mekdi” package to couples getting hitched in Jakarta, the country’s capital.</p><p>For around $230, McDonald’s is offering newlyweds various catering options, including 100 chicken sandwiches and 100 servings of four chicken McNuggets.</p><p>For a wedding with 100 attendees, the package works out at just over $2 a head—or around 97% less than the average couple marrying in America paid for catering last year.</p><p>Representatives for McDonald’s Indonesia did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.</p><p>However, Rizki Haryadi, a spokesperson for the company, told news outlet The Sun U.S. that McDonald’s was offering newlyweds plenty of service options for after their ceremony, including food stalls. He clarified, though, that the deal does not include exchanging vows in one of the company’s restaurants.</p><p>“The wedding package is not for holding a wedding at a McD store, but only for food,” he said, noting that there was “a minimum purchase of 200 products.”</p><p>McWedding packages</p><p>For those interested in tying the knot beneath the Golden Arches, McDonald’s has long been offering wedding ceremonies and parties in Hong Kong. The so-called McWedding packages, which reportedly cost around $380, are customizable but can include Chinese or Western decorations, balloons, and an Apple Pie display in lieu of a cake.</p><p>McDonald’s isn’t the only big name in the fast food space to have forayed into the wedding industry.</p><p>Taco Bell fans can get married at the company’s flagship store in Las Vegas, which includes a ceremony in its “chapel with a twist,” custom wedding merchandise, a Cinnabon cake, and a Taco Bell sauce packet bouquet. Couples can book a $777 Taco Bell wedding just four hours before their ceremony, as long as they abide by Taco Bell’s wedding dress code: “no shirt, no shoes, no marriage.”</p><p>In 2020, an Australian couple had a KFC-themed wedding reception after winning a competition held by the company. The prize wedding package included a KFC photo booth, a wedding cake, and buckets of the firm’s trademark fried chicken.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>bride 新娘</p><p>nugget 有价值的小东西，有用的想法（或事实）；至理名言；鸡块，鱼块</p><p>spiraling 螺旋式上升；急剧上升</p><p>arm 职能部门，分支机构</p><p>hitch 小问题，临时故障</p><p>get hitched 结婚</p><p>newlywed 新婚夫妇</p><p>catering 餐饮业，准备或提供食物的工作</p><p>work out 锻炼身体，发生，发展，进展顺利；结果是，算下来</p><p>stall 推迟；货摊，摊位；分隔间</p><p>clarify 澄清，阐明</p><p>tie the knot 喜结连理</p><p>customizable 可定制的</p><p>lieu 替代，取代</p><p>foray 涉足，初次尝试；短程旅行，短暂访问；突袭，闪电式侵袭</p><p>flagship 王牌，最重要产品，旗舰</p><p>chapel 小教堂</p><p>twist 转折，转变</p><p>merchandise 商品，货品</p><p>bouquet 花束</p><p>abide by  遵守，遵循（协议、决定或规章）</p><p>dress code 着装标准，着装规定</p><p>reception 感受，反应，回应；接受效果；欢迎会，招待会</p><p>booth  小亭，小房间</p><p>bucket 桶</p><p>trademark 商标；标记，特征</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Since then, an IAEA task force has conducted several reviews of the nation’s progress in treating the water.</p><p>For years, Tepco, the power company that operated the plant and that is now overseeing its decommissioning, said that treatment of the water — which involves sending it through a powerful filtration system to remove most radioactive material — was making it safe to release.</p><p>Critics say that the Japanese government and Tepco have not been transparent enough about the treatment process or the planned release.</p><p>Wu Jianghao, China’s ambassador to Japan, said in a news conference on Tuesday that “Japan should stop the plan to release the water into the sea, but seriously consult with the international community and consider a scientific, safe, transparent and convincing response.” He added that Japan had made its decision without “sufficient consultations.”</p><p>Even within Japan, opinion is divided. In a poll released over the weekend by JNN, a Japanese television network, 45 percent of respondents supported the plan, while 40 percent said they were against it.</p><p>“So many good scientists feel that the data presented so far has been incomplete,” said Azby Brown, lead researcher with SafeCast, an independent radiation-monitoring group.</p><p>Mr. Brown said that the health risk posed by the released water will “be very low and a magnitude of thousands of times lower than everyday exposure” to radiation. “But the entire process has not been transparent enough,” he said. “It has not been inclusive, and they have not been thorough.”</p><p>Tokyo has offered repeated assurances that the water is safe enough to be released into the ocean, saying that filtration has removed most isotopes, though it does contain traces of tritium, an isotope that is hard to separate from water, as well as small traces of carbon-14 and iodine-129, according to Mr. Brown.</p><p>At a meeting with Mr. Grossi, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan said the nation “would not approve a release that could have a negative impact on people in Japan and the world and the environment.” He added that the government would “continue to thoroughly explain in and outside of Japan” its rationale for releasing the treated water into the sea, “based on scientific grounds with high transparency.”</p><p>Hirokazu Matsuno, chief cabinet secretary to Mr. Kishida, said on Tuesday that the discharge was still on target for this summer after the government had reviewed safety measures and considered “damages resulting from rumors” in other countries.</p><p>How to respond to the discharge of Fukushima water has become a deeply polarizing issue in South Korea, threatening the fragile rapprochement between Seoul and Tokyo that began earlier this year.</p><p>Recent surveys showed that 80 to 85 percent of South Koreans opposed Japan’s plan to dump the Fukushima water into the Pacific and worried about the impact it would have on seafood and the marine environment.</p><p>Mr. Grossi will visit Seoul on Friday to discuss the rising anxiety in South Korea, where salt prices have surged in recent weeks after people started hoarding sea salt harvested from salt ponds on the country’s west coast ahead of the discharge.</p><p>Park Gwangon, a leader of South Korea’s opposition Democratic Party, cited fears among South Koreans that the IAEA’s safety review would be “political, rather than scientific” and “tailored for Japan.”</p><p>The South Korean government has tried to dispel fears among its residents by vowing to ramp up efforts to monitor seawater, fisheries and natural salt farms for any rise in radioactive substances.</p><p>Government officials reassured the public on Monday that South Korea’s ban on seafood from the waters near Fukushima — first imposed following the 2011 disaster — would remain in place even after Japan began discharging the treated water.</p><p>Mr. Grossi said that the water release method being deployed in Japan has a “proven track record” in many other countries, including China, South Korea and the United States. Under the current plan, the water would be released in a controlled, gradual manner over the course of several decades.</p><p>The water Japan plans to discharge into the Pacific was mainly used to cool damaged reactors at the Fukushima power plant, which was destroyed in 2011 by an earthquake and tsunami. Japan says it needs to release the water that’s currently stored before the plant runs out of storage space.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>metric ton 公吨</p><p>radioactive 放射性的</p><p>plant 工厂，电厂</p><p>negligible 微不足道的，可忽略的，不重要的</p><p>provoke 引起，激起；激怒，挑衅</p><p>controversy 争议</p><p>proceed 继续做</p><p>discharge  准许某人离开，解雇，允许出院，释放；开枪，射出；排放</p><p>proposal 提议，计划，建议</p><p>oversee 监管</p><p>decommission 关闭，停止使用（设备或武器）</p><p>filtration 过滤，滤除</p><p>ambassador 大使</p><p>divide 使产生分歧，使意见不一</p><p>respondent 回答者，答复者</p><p>pose 姿势；造成，引起；提出，质询</p><p>magnitude 巨大，重大；震级</p><p>inclusive 包容的</p><p>assurance 保证</p><p>isotope 同位素</p><p>rationale 根本原因，基本原理</p><p>polarize 两极分化</p><p>fragile 脆弱的，易碎的</p><p>dump 抛弃，丢弃；倾销，甩卖</p><p>marine 海的，海产的；海上贸易的，货船的</p><p>hoard 囤积，贮藏</p><p>dispel 驱除，打消</p><p>vow 发誓</p><p>ramp up 加快，增加，提高</p><p>substance 物质，材料；重要性，要旨，实质；根据</p><p>reassure 使安心，打消··的疑虑</p><p>impose 推行，强制实行；把···强加于；打扰，麻烦</p><p>tsunami 海啸</p></blockquote>]]></content>

She was 48.</p><p>The cause was suicide, according to a statement from her sisters, Carol and Nancy Lee. Ms. Lee was taken to a hospital on Sunday after she attempted suicide at her home, they said.</p><p>“Coco had been suffering from depression for a few years but her condition deteriorated drastically over the last few months,” her sisters wrote. “Although Coco sought professional help and did her best to fight depression, sadly that demon inside of her took the better of her.”</p><p>Ms. Lee had built a successful career as a pop singer in Asia, but she was best known to American audiences for singing the song “A Love Before Time” in the 2000 film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” The song was nominated for an Oscar in the best new original song category, and she performed it in front of a television audience of millions at the Academy Awards ceremony in March 2001.</p><p>“Combining the flavor and texture of Eastern music with the orchestral color and sensitive lyrics of Western culture, the magic of this stunningly beautiful film is truly realized in this evocative love ballad,” the actress Julia Stiles said as she introduced Ms. Lee’s performance.</p><p>Her career as a recording artist began after she finished as the runner-up in a singing competition hosted by the television broadcaster TVB in Hong Kong in 1993, shortly after she graduated from high school. Ms. Lee entered the competition on a whim, she told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2000, and stumbled upon success.</p><p>“I was timid as a kid,” she said. “I would hide in the bathroom and sing in the shower. I always predicted my older sister Nancy would be the singer. She’s beautiful, talented and she’s got nice legs. I had no idea it would be me.”</p><p>But being selected as runner-up in the TVB contest led to the release of her debut album with a Taiwanese record label in 1994. “My goal in the singing business is not to stay in one place,” she told a reporter for The South China Morning Post in 1997, saying that she wanted to work in Asia and the U.S.</p><p>In 1999, Ms. Lee released her first full English language album, “Just No Other Way,” which featured pop and R&amp;B songs. One track, “Before I Fall In Love,” was included on the soundtrack for the Julia Roberts film “Runaway Bride.”</p><p>Ms. Lee’s career also expanded beyond music. She voiced the lead character in the Mandarin version of Disney’s 1998 animated film “Mulan,” in addition to singing the movie’s theme song, “Reflection.”</p><p>Ms. Lee, who was born on Jan. 17, 1975, in Hong Kong, moved to the United States and attended middle and high school in San Francisco, where she was crowned Miss Teen Chinatown in 1991. She briefly attended the University of California at Irvine, intending to study biology and become a doctor, but dropped out after her freshman year, she told The Chronicle.</p><p>In their statement, Ms. Lee’s sisters noted that this year marked the 30th anniversary of the launch of her accomplished singing career. Ms. Lee was “known to have worked tirelessly to open up a new world for Chinese singers in the international music scene,” they wrote, highlighting her “excellent live performances.”</p><p>In addition to her sisters, Ms. Lee’s survivors include her husband, Bruce Rockowitz, and two stepdaughters. A complete list was not immediately available.</p><p>Her last single, called “Tragic,” was released in February. In a post to her social media at the end of 2022, Ms. Lee acknowledged having had an “incredibly difficult year” but encouraged her followers to spread positivity and “be an influential figure to inspire people.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>nominate 提名，推荐</p><p>crouch 蹲下，蹲伏</p><p>deteriorate 恶化</p><p>drastically 彻底地，剧烈地</p><p>demon 恶魔</p><p>flavor 风味，味道</p><p>texture 质感，质地；韵味，特色，格调</p><p>orchestral 管弦乐的</p><p>lyrics 歌词</p><p>stunningly 极漂亮的，极迷人的；惊人的，绝妙的</p><p>evocative 引起愉快的回忆的，产生美好联想的，唤起美好感情的</p><p>ballad 民谣，民歌</p><p>runner-up 亚军，第二名</p><p>on a whim 一时兴起，一时冲动</p><p>chronicle 编年史，年代记；记述，记录</p><p>stumble 犯错，失足；踉跄，绊脚</p><p>label 公司，品牌商品，公司标志</p><p>track 一首歌曲，一首乐曲；追踪</p><p>soundtrack 电影配乐，电影原声带</p><p>survivor （某人去世后）仍然活着的家人</p></blockquote>]]></content>

With that kind of money, one might wonder why she isn’t streaming 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365 to earn more.</p><p>During a recent appearance on The Iced Coffee Hour, Amouranth was asked about how much she earns from ‘sleep streams’ which are exactly what they sound like. She streams herself while sleeping.</p><p>Unclear on the exact numbers, Amouranth ballparked that she earns between $10,000 and $15,000 for each sleep stream. Kaitlyn said “If you count just on Twitch, probably like a couple thousand dollars, but, if you count the conversions, potentially, to OnlyFans, while I’m sleeping, then maybe like $10,000-$15,000.”</p><p>They pressed her on why, if she’s earning $15,000 just for sleeping, she doesn’t keep the stream going every time she falls asleep.</p><p>Her answer was basically that she’s a busy woman. She often wakes up and has to get ready for photoshoots or meetings, etc., and a continuous stream simply isn’t possible given all of the moving parts in her daily&#x2F;weekly schedule.</p><p>Earning $15K while sleeping would be a LOT of people’s dream but to that, I’d say dream bigger.</p><p>For context, when Elon Musk’s net worth was $233 billion he was earning roughly $26,605,022 per hour according to Google. Elon sleeps roughly 6 hours per night, so he’s averaging $159,630,132&#x2F;night according to Valuewalk but those numbers seem a little fishy to me.</p><p>Kaitlyn Siragusa has an estimated net worth of around $25 million, according to most reports. Those numbers also seem fishy given that Amouranth earns $2 million&#x2F;month at times.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>aka 又名，亦称 also known as 的简写</p><p>Boomer 尤指二战后生育高峰出生的人</p><p>Gen X 60后和70后</p><p>dominate 占支配地位，占主导地位，最明显的</p><p>streaming 在线收听或收看</p><p>personality 个性，性格；名人，名流</p><p>ballpark 大致估计，粗略计算</p><p>conversion 转化，转变，改变</p><p>net worth 资产净值</p><p>fishy 可疑的，虚假的；鱼味的，鱼腥味的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

He said the move was part of “drastic and immediate” action to restrict access to tweets because AI companies were stealing Twitter’s data. </p><p>Despite Musk insisting the restrictions are temporary, some users have been confused and irritated by the sudden change of rules.</p><p>“How on earth did I already use up all my rate limits,” Rawsalerts, a media account, tweeted, along with a screenshot of the account’s limited timeline. “Now I can’t even see my own tweets what is happening.”</p><p>YouTube star MrBeast also chimed in on the drama: “I hit my tweet viewing limit for the day. Wtf do I do with my life now.”</p><p>“It is time I just quit Twitter at this point,” Matt Navarra, a social-media expert, posted in response to another user complaining they couldn’t access his content. </p><p>Others took to joking about the new restrictions. One user poked fun at the risk the policy might reduce views: “Babe no your tweet’s a banger! Everyone just exceeded their rate limit before they saw it! Babe trust me!”</p><p>Another joked about their attempts to slow down their scrolling, posting a meme with the text: “Me trying to not scroll fast and waste my 600 tweet limit.”</p><p>Musk also appeared to try and join in the fun, retweeting a parody account of himself that said the view limit was an attempt to make Twitter addicts “go outside.” </p><p>Representatives for Twitter did not respond to Insider’s request for comment with a message that addressed the question.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>shake-up 调整，改组</p><p>verify 核实，证明，证实</p><p>spark 引发</p><p>backlash 强烈抵制，集体反对</p><p>unregistered 未注册，未登记的</p><p>sign up 注册，报名参加</p><p>drastic 剧烈的，极端的</p><p>insist 坚持说，强调，坚决要求</p><p>irritate 激怒</p><p>chime in 附和；插话（通常表示赞同）</p><p>poke fun at 打趣，取笑某人</p><p>banger 香肠；老爷车；爆竹</p><p>exceed 超过</p><p>meme 指网上迅速传播流行起来的一些概念，类似段子，梗，表情包</p><p>parody 滑稽模仿作品；拙劣的模仿</p><p>addict 有瘾的人，入迷的人</p></blockquote>]]></content>

It did not give Cai’s full name.</p><p>“Related brands, performance management firms, and multi-channel network operators are requested to control risks of male singer Cai.”</p><p>Chinese authorities have kept a close eye on the domestic entertainment sector in recent years, launching a wide-ranging crackdown on dodgy financial practices and “immoral” conduct in 2021 after numerous scandals implicated some of the nation’s biggest entertainers.</p><p>In November, Chinese-Canadian superstar Kris Wu was sentenced to 13 years in jail after being found guilty of rape.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>icon 偶像；图标</p><p>embroil 使卷入（纠纷），使陷入（困境）</p><p>one-night stand 一夜情</p><p>coerce 强迫，胁迫</p><p>lucrative 赚钱的，盈利的</p><p>feature 特征，特点</p><p>broadcaster 节目主持人</p><p>yield 产生，提供；放弃，让出</p><p>implore 恳请，恳求</p><p>constrain 限制，约束</p><p>supervision 监督</p><p>sponsor 赞助商</p><p>wane 衰减，减弱</p><p>hype 大肆宣传，炒作</p><p>crackdown 制裁，处罚，打击</p><p>dodgy 不诚实的，不怀好意的；不可靠的，有风险的</p><p>implicate 牵连，涉及</p><p>sentence  宣判；句子</p></blockquote>]]></content>

That put it far and away ahead of other Chinese new releases and Hollywood’s holdovers “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” and “The Flash.”</p><p>With the Dragon Boat Festival holiday occurring on Thursday, the film was given an unusual one-day advance on the normal releasing pattern in China. Including Thursday takings, the film made a total of $98.3 million (RMB968 million).</p><p>Data from Comscore shows “Lost in the Stars” handily beating second-placed “Elemental,” which earned $49.8 million between Friday and Sunday ($31.3 million in 40 international markets and $18.5 million in North America).</p><p>“Lost in the Stars” is a Chinese adaptation of a 1990 Russian movie “A Trap for the Lonely Man,” which itself was adapted from a Robert Thomas stage play. It sees a woman disappear while on an overseas trip with her husband. Just as mysteriously, she reappears at the moment that the search for her is running out of steam. But the man refuses to accept that she is the same woman and believes that she is an imposter.</p><p>The Chinese adaptation was scripted by hitmaker Chen Sicheng (“Detective Chinatown” franchise) and co-directed by Liu Xiang (“Knock Knock”) and Cui Rui. The cast is headed by Zhu Yilong, Ni Ni, Janice Man and Du Jiang.</p><p>Chinese romance film “Love Never Ends” was given a five-day opening run and placed second. Over the Friday-Sunday weekend, it earned $11.8 million (RMB83.7 million) according to Artisan Gateway. Over five days, it earned $23.7 million.</p><p>“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” slipped from second place to third.</p><p>“Never Say Never,” written and directed by actor Wang Baoqiang (“Lost in Thailand,” “Detective Chinatown”) does not officially release in China until July 6. Nevertheless, its previews were strong enough to earn it $6.3 million (RMB44.5 million) and take fourth place over the weekend. Earnings to date add up to $9.4 million.</p><p>“The Flash” shot rapidly downwards, falling from first place on its opening weekend to fifth place in its second session. It grossed $3.4 million between Friday and Sunday, for a ten-day cumulative of $23.7 million.</p><p>China’s huge park of Imax screens played three of the top five titles. “Lost in the Stars” earned $1.5M of its total on the circuit. “The Flash” earned $670,000. “Transformers: Rise of the beasts” earned $1 million.</p><p>Nationwide, China’s box office haul was $111 million over the weekend. That lifts the year-to-date total to $3.52 billion.

Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.”</p><p>Hundreds of schools have for decades utilized affirmative action programs to one degree or another to boost the admissions of racial minorities at places where whites only had dominated. U.S. businesses and government agencies have also utilized affirmative action plans, although Thursday’s ruling dealt only with admission to colleges.</p><p>In a dissent, one of the court’s liberals, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said the decision “rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.” In a separate dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson — the court’s first Black female justice — called the decision “truly a tragedy for us all.”</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden said, “I strongly, strongly disagree with the court’s decision. I believe our colleges are stronger when they are racially diverse.”</p><p>Much like its decision a year ago overturning the national right to abortion, the court was overturning its previous rulings.</p><p>The Supreme Court had twice upheld race-conscious college admissions programs in the past 20 years, including as recently as 2016.</p><p>But former President Donald Trump’s appointment of three conservative jurists to the Supreme Court tipped the balance against affirmative action.</p><p>The ruling was not unexpected. All six conservative justices expressed concerns about the practice at arguments last October, even though lower courts had upheld the affirmative action programs at both Harvard and UNC, rejecting claims that the schools discriminated against white and Asian-American applicants.</p><p>Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate ahead of the 2024 election, called the decision “a great day for America.”</p><p>In a short address from the White House, President Biden said “We cannot let this decision be the last word,” adding that “discrimination still exists in America. We need a higher education system that works for everyone.”</p><p>Consistent with the ruling moving forward, Biden called on universities to give greater consideration to other aspects of the background of applicants, including the financial wherewithal of the student or their family, where a student grew up and went to high school and the personal experiences of hardship or discrimination, including racial discrimination, that a student may have faced.</p><p>Many schools, in the expectation that the court’s conservative majority would block the use of affirmative action, say they already are giving greater weight to Biden’s suggested considerations in making admission decisions, along with factoring in test scores, high school grade point averages, and application essays.</p><p>Other reaction to the court decision also broke down along predictable ideological lines, with Democratic lawmakers denouncing the decision and Republicans applauding it.</p><p>Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “The Supreme Court ruling has put a giant roadblock in our country’s march toward racial justice.”</p><p>He added, “The consequences of this decision will be felt immediately and across the country, as students of color will face an admission cycle next year with fewer opportunities to attend the same colleges and universities as their parents and older siblings. These negative consequences could continue for generations, as the historic harms of exclusion and discrimination in education and society are exacerbated.”</p><p>Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate minority leader, characterized the ruling as “a long overdue step toward ensuring equal protection under the law. For decades, the court turned a blind eye as higher education prioritized illegal social engineering over merit.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>strike sth down 裁定（某法律条文）非法</p><p>affirmative action 平权行动</p><p>unconstitutional 违宪的</p><p>conservative 保守的</p><p>overturn 推翻，打翻</p><p>prospective 有望的，可能的，预期的，潜在的，即将发生的</p><p>touchstone 检验标准，试金石</p><p>best 击败，战胜</p><p>boost 促进，改善，提高</p><p>dominate 占支配地位，占主导地位</p><p>dissent 不同意，异议</p><p>liberal 自由开放的，开放的，开明的</p><p>precedent 先例，前例</p><p>momentous 重要的，重大的</p><p>abortion 堕胎，人工流产</p><p>tip the balance 打破平衡</p><p>wherewithal 必要的资金</p><p>ideological 意识形态上的，思想体系上的</p><p>denounce 斥责，指责，谴责</p><p>exclusion 排斥</p><p>exacerabate 加剧</p><p>overdue 过期的，延误的，迟的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

This advice for individuals comes from a separate WHO expert committee on food additives, known as JECFA (the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organization’s Expert Committee on Food Additives), alongside determinations from national regulators.</p><p>However, similar IARC rulings in the past for different substances have raised concerns among consumers about their use, led to lawsuits, and pressured manufacturers to recreate recipes and swap to alternatives. That has led to criticism that the IARC’s assessments can be confusing to the public.</p><p>JECFA, the WHO committee on additives, is also reviewing aspartame use this year. Its meeting began at the end of June and it is due to announce its findings on the same day that the IARC makes public its decision – on July 14.</p><p>Since 1981, JECFA has said aspartame is safe to consume within accepted daily limits. For example, an adult weighing 60 kg (132 pounds) would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda – depending on the amount of aspartame in the beverage – every day to be at risk. Its view has been widely shared by national regulators, including in the United States and Europe.</p><p>An IARC spokesperson said both the IARC and JECFA committees’ findings were confidential until July, but added they were “complementary”, with IARC’s conclusion representing “the first fundamental step to understand carcinogenicity”. The additives committee “conducts risk assessment, which determines the probability of a specific type of harm (e.g., cancer) to occur under certain conditions and levels of exposure.”</p><p>However, industry and regulators fear that holding both processes at around the same time could be confusing, according to letters from U.S. and Japanese regulators seen by Reuters.</p><p>“We kindly ask both bodies to coordinate their efforts in reviewing aspartame to avoid any confusion or concerns among the public,” Nozomi Tomita, an official from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, wrote in a letter dated March 27 to WHO’s deputy director general, Zsuzsanna Jakab.</p><p>The letter, reviewed by Reuters, also called for the conclusions of both bodies to be released on the same day, as is now happening. The Japanese mission in Geneva, where the WHO is based, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>artificial 人工的，人造的</p><p>sweetener 甜味剂</p><p>carcinogen 致癌物质</p><p>pit sb&#x2F;sth against sb&#x2F;sth 使相斗，使竞争，使较量</p><p>arm 职能部门，分支机构，分部</p><p>ruling 裁决，裁定，判定，决定</p><p>finalise 最后定下</p><p>hazard 危险物</p><p>additive 添加剂</p><p>substance 物质，材料；重要性，要旨，实质，根据</p><p>recipe 食谱；方法，秘诀</p><p>beverage 饮料</p><p>confidential 保密的</p><p>complementary 补充的，互补的</p><p>coordinate 协调，相互配合</p></blockquote>]]></content>

href="#Three-Australian-universities-place-in-top-20-of-QS-World-University-Rankings" class="headerlink" title="Three Australian universities place in top 20 of QS World University Rankings"></a><strong>Three Australian universities place in top 20 of QS World University Rankings</strong></h1><hr><p>Three Australian universities have made the world’s top 20 list for the first time after new metrics placing greater weight on international research and sustainability were introduced.</p><p>The QS World University Rankings, run by global higher education specialist Quacquarelli Symonds, draws from millions of academic papers and insights from 240,000 academics and employers across 1,500 universities.</p><p>The University of Melbourne ranked 14th on the list, a historic high for any Australian university, while the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney tied for 19th.</p><p>The Australian National University, Monash University and the University of Queensland also ranked in the top 50 at 34, 42 and 43 respectively.</p><p>The University of Melbourne jumped from 33 to 14 in the survey, cementing its place as the highest ranked university in Australia across the three major global rankings – QS, Times Higher Education, where it ranked 34, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities, where it ranked 32.</p><p>The leap was due to a strong showing in the academic reputation category and a high place in three new categories announced this year by QS including employment outcomes, international research, and sustainability, which measures how well a university used sustainable practices to tackle both social and environmental impacts.</p><p>QS World University Rankings said the metrics, introduced on its 20th anniversary, reflected shifts in the sector and changing priorities of students.</p><p>Under the new system, Australia ranked 11th worldwide on sustainability programs and research with the University of Sydney ranking seventh.</p><p>For the first time this year, the weighting of academic reputation and faculty student ratios were also downgraded, to 30% and 10% respectively.</p><p>Of the “big four” study destinations – Australia, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom – which house the majority of QS top 300 universities, Australia received the highest overall score of 40.7 out of 100.</p><p>It scored top on academic reputation, citations, international faculty ratio and international research, while coming out last on its faculty student ratio which assesses teaching resources.</p><p>Some 29 Australian universities slid in the category after significant job cuts during the height of the pandemic in 2021.</p><p>The UK had the highest proportion of international students, followed by Australia, which enrolled 619,370 foreign students in 2022.</p><p>It’s up from 2021 but still 18% below 2019 levels, largely driven by Indian students after a decline in the Chinese market.</p><p>The University of Melbourne vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, said the new categories represented “things that are important to students when they make decisions about where to study”, adding he was “very pleased” the institution had rated so highly.</p><p>“The QS Rankings have reaffirmed Australian universities are among the very best in the world,” he said. “It is an unprecedented level of recognition that underlines the significant contribution that universities make to the nation’s global reputation.”</p><p>The vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, Mark Scott, said the university had jumped 22 places to reach its highest ranking to date: “These outstanding results are a win for the higher education sector in Australia.</p><p>“We know our research is world-class and the education our students receive at universities across Australia is amongst the best in the world and this outcome is a testament to that.”</p><p>The University of Sydney ranked 31st for academic reputation and 13th for international students worldwide, regarded as a proxy measure for how “attractive” a university was to the international market.</p><p>The UNSW vice chancellor, Attila Brungs, said the result was a testament to the university’s strategy to focus on tackling “the most important challenges facing society”.</p><p>“What is most exciting is the opportunity this excellent result presents for us to amplify our societal impact and be at the forefront of positive change,” he said.</p><p>The QS senior vice-president, Ben Sowter, said it had “closely aligned” rankings with the priorities of gen Z and Alpha: “This … captures the core concerns of an increasingly socially conscious student population, in our rapidly evolving world.</p><p>“They must commit to sustainability, foster graduate employability, and intensify international collaboration to address the world’s pressing challenges.”</p><p>For the 12th consecutive year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology maintained its reign at the top, while the University of Cambridge came in second and the University of Oxford took third.</p><p>Ten of the top 20 universities were based in the US, while four were in the UK. Singapore, Switzerland and China were also represented in the top 20.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>metrics 指标，度量，衡量指标</p><p>sustainability 持续性，永续性</p><p>tie 平局，平手</p><p>cement 水泥；加固，巩固</p><p>leap 跳跃，激增，猛涨</p><p>category 种类，类别，范畴</p><p>faculty 机能；能力，才能；全体教师</p><p>downgrade 降级，降职，贬低，轻视</p><p>citation 引用，引文</p><p>slide 滑动，滑行</p><p>vice-chancellor （美国大学或学院主管部分工作的）副校长；（英国大学或学院主持工作的校长）</p><p>reaffirm 重申</p><p>unprecedented 前所未有的，空前的</p><p>proxy 代理人，代表；代理权</p><p>amplify 加强，放大</p><p>align 排整齐，校准；使成一条直线；使一致</p><p>conscious 清醒的，有意识的，有知觉的</p><p>pressing 紧迫的，迫切的</p><p>consecutive 连续的，连贯的，不间断的</p><p>reign 为王，为君；当政，统治；主宰的时期</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Her boss promises to help her report the harassment, and in an indication of how often such politically inconvenient complaints are ignored, says, “Let’s not just let this go this time.”</p><p>That quote from the fictional supervisor became a clarion call, inspiring more than 100 accusers, mostly women, to speak out on social media, sharing their accounts of unwanted kisses, groping and in a few cases, attempted rape. They described the indignities endured at the workplace, including inappropriate touching and unwanted advances by male colleagues and bosses, as well as lewd comments. Some of their posts have been shared thousands of times.</p><p>Allegations have also been made against men across Taiwan’s society more broadly, including in academia, journalism, and most recently, entertainment.</p><p>Mickey Huang, a TV personality, apologized after being accused by a woman he met at work of kissing her without her consent and forcing her to be photographed nude. Aaron Yan, a pop star, apologized after an ex-boyfriend accused him of secretly shooting videos of them having sex, when the ex-boyfriend was 16, a minor. Local prosecutors said this week they would investigate the allegation.</p><p>In some ways, the #MeToo movement points to a generational shift in attitudes brought about by the hard-fought advances won by women’s rights activists in decades past. Taiwan’s younger generation started learning about gender equality in elementary school, as part of curriculum changes enacted in 2004, and have since come of age.</p><p>But workplaces are struggling to keep pace.</p><p>Taiwan’s younger generation has “a higher awareness of gender diversity and equality than the older generation,” said Wei-Ting Yen, an assistant professor of government at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania. “However, the workplace that young people are entering is still dominated by the older generation.”</p><p>Women’s rights groups have called for Taiwan to extend the statute of limitations for sexual harassment complaints, currently at one year.</p><p>But activists also say more needs to be done to address the culture of sexism that underlies the misconduct and deters many women from speaking out. A survey last year showed that only a tiny percentage of female respondents who said they had encountered sexual harassment at work had filed complaints. Activists and scholars in Taiwan say that men in power, whether they are supervisors in workplaces or police officers or judges, are often seen as sympathetic toward other men in power, and likely to blame the victim.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>allegation 指责，指控</p><p>judicial 司法的，审判的</p><p>reckoning 估计，估算，计算；最后审判日，算总账</p><p>harassment 骚扰</p><p>entrench 根深蒂固的</p><p>outpouring 倾泻，流露，迸发</p><p>subplot 次要情节</p><p>quote 引用，引述，援引</p><p>clarion call 号召，召唤</p><p>grope 摸索，搜寻；猥亵</p><p>indignity 无礼，侮辱，轻蔑</p><p>advance 挑逗，勾引，追求</p><p>lewd 淫秽的，色情的，下流的</p><p>personality 性格，个性；名人，名流</p><p>consent 同意</p><p>nude  裸体的；肉色的</p><p>minor 未成年人；辅修科目</p><p>prosecutor 检察官；原告律师</p><p>hard-fought 艰苦奋斗得来的</p><p>curriculum 课程</p><p>enact 颁布；通过，实施，制定；表演</p><p>diversity 多样化</p><p>dominate 占主导地位</p><p>statute 法令，规则</p><p>underlie 是···的深层原因；对···有重大影响</p><p>misconduct 失职，处理不当，行为不端</p><p>deter 阻止，威慑</p><p>file 提起诉讼；提出申请，送交备案</p><p>sympathetic 同情的；支持的，赞同的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

On Friday, an official confirmation will be communicated to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where Prada is publicly listed. </p><p>At that meeting, Patrizio Bertelli, who shares the CEO role with his wife Miuccia Prada, was recommended as chairman of the group. As reported, he is expected to be confirmed in this role at the group’s general assembly this spring.</p><p>The changes are part of a newly revised organization and a future management handover at the Italian luxury company. Bertelli and Prada’s son Lorenzo Bertelli is expected to lead the group in a few years time.</p><p>Lorenzo Bertelli has increased his responsibilities and been a driver of change since joining the company in 2017. He was named group marketing director in 2019 and, additionally, head of corporate social responsibility in 2020. In May 2021, he joined as a director of the board. </p><p>Guerra will likely be in charge of a potential second listing in Milan for the group, whose shares have been trading in Hong Kong since 2011. </p><p>In November 2021, during the group’s Capital Markets Day, Patrizio Bertelli admitted: “We could explore a listing in Europe. That said, we don’t feel the need to now; we are OK this way.”</p><p>A dual listing can help diversify the risks for investors in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has increased the volatility of global stock markets.</p><p>As part of the succession plan, Miuccia Prada in December was confirmed as creative director of Miu Miu and Prada, the latter together with Belgian designer Raf Simons, and a board member. She is relinquishing her role as co-CEO.</p><p>In November, Simons shuttered his own namesake line after 27 years leading to speculation about a possible increased role at the Prada brand in the future.</p><p>Guerra was named CEO in early 2020 of the newly created LVMH Hospitality Excellence division, but in May he became a strategic and development senior adviser to the French group.</p><p>He left eyewear group Luxottica, where he’d become instrumental to the growth of the company, in September 2014 after 10 years working with founder Leonardo Del Vecchio.</p><p>After Luxottica, Guerra became a strategic adviser to former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and then joined Italian high-end food emporium Eataly as executive chairman in 2015.</p><p>The relationship between Patrizio Bertelli and Guerra is a long-standing one, as Luxottica started producing the Prada and Miu Miu eyewear collections in 2003.</p><p>In another development for the business, earlier this month Gianfranco D’Attis took on the role of CEO of the Prada brand, reporting to the group.

Wagner soldiers who took part in the mutiny will be granted amnesty, while those who stayed in their barracks will be offered a contract with the defense ministry, he added.</p><p>Security forces in Moscow were seen dismantling barricades that had been hastily assembled as rebel troops neared the capital.</p><p>Lukashenko said he spent most of Saturday negotiating with Prigozhin and Putin, adding that all sides had agreed “that unleashing a bloodbath on the territory of Russia was unacceptable.” The deal offered to Prigozhin is “absolutely advantageous and acceptable,” and will involve security guarantees for Wagner, he added.</p><p>There were no further details, particularly about the fate of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the chief of Russia’s general staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, whose removal Prigozhin had demanded as he seized Rostov and sent his troops marching toward the capital. Peskov said the issue hasn’t been discussed with Lukashenko. Prigozhin himself didn’t make any statements about leaving Russia.</p><p>The tentative truce was the latest twist in a tumultuous day that raised serious questions about Putin’s hold on power and underscored growing tensions within the Russian establishment and armed forces.</p><p>It was less clear what the day’s fast-moving events meant for Prigozhin. The march on Moscow initially highlighted his formidable clout as leader of a motivated and well-armed paramilitary force, contrasting sharply with a Russian military largely demoralized after 16 months of fighting in Ukraine. But the end result raised questions about whether Prigozhin had miscalculated and whether he would be able to retain any power while in Belarus.</p><p>“Understanding all the responsibility that Russian blood may be spilled by one of the sides, we have turned around our columns and are returning to the field camps, according to plan,” Prigozhin said.</p><p>For Putin, who on Saturday morning accused Prigozhin of treason and ordered his military to crush Wagner’s “mutiny,” the deal brokered by Lukashenko represented a climbdown. It was caused, in part, by the fact that Russia’s security forces by and large didn’t resist as Wagner’s columns swiftly moved toward Moscow, coming to within 125 miles of the capital.</p><p>The specter of all-out war between rival Russian forces had grown during the day as columns of Wagner tanks, artillery and personnel carriers were spotted crossing the Voronezh and Lipetsk regions, coming closer and closer to Moscow. There were no major attempts to stop them on the M4 highway by Russian ground forces, though the column was occasionally attacked by Russian combat aircraft.</p><p>Video footage showed the main Voronezh fuel depot ablaze after an airstrike, the wreckage of several helicopters, and one warplane being shot out of the sky. Fighterbomber, a Russian military aviation Telegram channel that is well connected with the Russian Air Force, said Wagner on Saturday downed six Russian helicopters, including a Ka-52 gunship, and an IL-18 or IL-22 airborne command center plane. A total of 12 Air Force crew died, according to Fighterbomber.</p><p>President Biden spoke about the situation in Russia with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and affirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine, the White House said.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>paramilitary 准军事的，非法军事组织的</p><p>halt 完全停止，停住</p><p>broker 作为经纪人&#x2F;中间人安排交易&#x2F;协议等</p><p>rebel 叛逆，反叛</p><p>avert 避免；转移</p><p>plunge 骤降；陷入，经历</p><p>relocate 搬迁，迁移，重新安置</p><p>mutiny 反叛，兵变</p><p>grant 拨款，补助金；同意，准予，授予</p><p>amnesty 赦免，大赦</p><p>barracks 兵营，营房</p><p>contract 合同，契约；染重病；收缩，缩小</p><p>dismantle 拆除，逐步废除</p><p>barricade 路障；把···堵在</p><p>hastily 匆忙地，急速地，慌忙地</p><p>assemble 聚集；组装，装配</p><p>unleash 解放，释放，发泄，爆发</p><p>tentative 暂时的</p><p>truce 休战，停战协定</p><p>tumultuous 动荡的，狂暴的；喧嚣的，热烈的</p><p>underscore 强调，突出显示</p><p>formidable 可怕的，令人敬畏的</p><p>clout 权势，影响力</p><p>demoralized 垂头丧气的</p><p>climbdown 认错，让步</p><p>specter 对于···的恐惧</p><p>artillery 大炮，炮兵</p><p>depot 车库，仓库</p><p>ablaze 熊熊燃烧的，光彩夺目的</p><p>aviation 航空学，飞行术，航空工业</p><p>unwavering 从不动摇的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

And our actions to defend the Fatherland against such a threat will be harsh. All those who deliberately stepped on the path of betrayal, who prepared an armed insurrection, who took the path of blackmail and terrorist methods, will suffer inevitable punishment, will answer both to the law and to our people,” Putin said, calling the Wagner group’s action a “stab in the back.”</p><p>Earlier Saturday, Russia said an anti-terrorist operation regime is up and running in Moscow, after Prigozhin vowed to overthrow Russia’s military leadership.</p><p>Russia is appealing to the mercenaries of the Wagner Group to abandon the organization and its leader.</p><p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement, posted on Telegram that was directed to the mercenary fighters, that they had been deceived and drawn into a “criminal adventure” orchestrated by Prigozhin.</p><p>Prigozhin said early Saturday his forces had seized control of the Russian army’s headquarters in Rostov and that his forces were in control of the city’s military sites.</p><p>“We are inside the (army) headquarters, it is 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT). Military sites in Rostov, including an aerodrome, are under control,” Prigozhin said in a video on Telegram.</p><p>Prigozhin and his fighters had crossed from Ukraine into Russia and entered Rostov, facing no resistance by border guards. Prigozhin said his men were ready to go “all the way” against the Russian military and would destroy anyone who stood in their way.</p><p>“Everyone who will try to put up resistance … we will consider it a threat and destroy it immediately, including any checkpoints that will be in our way and any aircraft that we see over our heads. I am asking everyone to remain calm and not succumb to provocations, stay in their homes. It is advisable not to go outside along the route of our movement,” he continued.</p><p>“After we finish what we started, we will return to the front to defend our Motherland,” Prigozhin said. “There are 25,000 of us, and we are going to figure out why this country is in such a mess. Twenty-five thousand are expected as a tactical reserve, and the strategic reserve is the whole army and the whole country. Everyone who wants to join. We must end this disgrace,” he said.</p><p><strong>What is the Wagner Group?</strong></p><p><strong>From: BBC</strong></p><p>The Wagner Group (officially called PMC Wagner) was first identified in 2014, when it was backing pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>At that time it was a secretive organisation, operating mostly in Africa and the Middle East, and is thought to have had only about 5,000 fighters - mostly veterans of Russia’s elite regiments and special forces.</p><p>Since then, it has grown considerably.</p><p>“Wagner almost certainly now commands 50,000 fighters in Ukraine and has become a key component of the Ukraine campaign,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in January.</p><p>Wagner started recruiting in large numbers in 2022 because Russia had trouble finding people for its regular army.</p><p>About 80% of Wagner’s troops in Ukraine have been drawn from prisons, the US National Security Council said at the start of this year.</p><p>Although mercenary forces are illegal in Russia, the Wagner Group registered as a company in 2022 and opened a new headquarters in St Petersburg.</p><p>“It is openly recruiting in Russian cities, on billboards, and is being named in Russian media as a patriotic organisation,” says Dr Samuel Ramani, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank.</p><p>The Wagner Group was heavily involved in Russia’s capture of the city of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>At first, the defence ministry did not mention that the Wagner Group was involved in the fighting. However, it later praised its mercenaries for playing a a “courageous and selfless” role.</p><p>The current head is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a rich businessman nicknamed “Putin’s chef” because he provided catering for the Kremlin.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>mercenary 雇佣兵</p><p>mutiny 反叛，哗变</p><p>treason 叛国罪</p><p>installation 装置艺术；用于军事目的的设施</p><p>blow 打击，不幸；浪费机会；泄露，暴露</p><p>stab sb in the back 背后捅刀子</p><p>regime 政府，政权，政体；组织方法，管理体制，体系</p><p>overthrow 推翻，打倒，打败</p><p>deceive 欺骗，蒙骗</p><p>orchestrate 精心安排，策划，密谋</p><p>aerodrome 飞机场</p><p>succumb  屈从，屈服，放弃抵抗，承认失败；病死，生病，受病痛折磨</p><p>provocation 激起，引起；激怒，挑衅</p><p>disgrace 耻辱，丢脸，不光彩的行为</p><p>separatist 分裂主义者</p><p>elite 精英</p><p>regiment 大批，大群，军队的团</p><p>command 命令，指示；指挥，统帅，管辖；应得，值得</p><p>recruit 招聘，吸收</p><p>billboard 广告牌</p><p>patriotic 爱国的</p><p>think tank 智囊团</p><p>catering 餐饮业。准备或提供食物的工作</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Titan lost contact with a research vessel on the surface about one hour and 45 minutes into the dive, kicking off a desperate, dayslong search for the submersible and its passengers. </p><p>The Coast Guard said Thursday it found debris consistent with “the catastrophic loss” of the submersible’s pressure chamber approximately 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic. </p><p><strong>What’s the latest update on the search?</strong> </p><p>The search uncovered five major pieces of debris that told investigators they had found the Titan’s remains, including a nose cone and the front-end bell of the pressure hull, officials said at a news briefing Thursday. </p><p>The debris was found on the ocean floor in a smooth area without any debris from the Titanic shipwreck, said Carl Hartsfield of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which was helping with the search.</p><p>“The debris is consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber,” said Coast Guard Rear Adm. John Mauger, who has been leading the search. Experts previously said death would have been instantaneous in those circumstances.</p><p>Asked about the prospect of finding the passengers’ bodies, Mauger said the operation took place in “an incredibly unforgiving environment.” </p><p>“We’ll continue to work and to search the area but I don’t have an answer for prospects,” he said.</p><p>Teams and equipment from around the world converged in a remote part of the North Atlantic to help with the search. They combed an area at least twice the size of Connecticut for the 22-foot-long Titan. </p><p>Rescuers had focused on an area where Canadian aircraft detected banging noises underwater, officials said Wednesday. Officials said Thursday there didn’t appear to be any connection between the noises and where debris from the vessel was found. </p><p><strong>What is the timeline of events?</strong></p><p>Officials are still piecing together a timeline to determine when the submersible imploded, Mauger said. </p><p>A top secret military acoustic detection system designed to spot enemy submarines first heard what the U.S. Navy suspected was the Titan implosion hours after the submersible began its voyage Sunday, according to officials involved in the search.</p><p><strong>Who were the passengers on the Titan submersible?</strong></p><p>Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood was on the craft with his 19-year-old son, Suleman, according to a statement from the family’s company. The Dawoods, one of Pakistan’s richest families, are owners of a conglomerate called Engro that produces everything from electricity to fertilizer to milk.</p><p>British aviator and explorer Hamish Harding was also on board, according to his company Action Aviation, which specializes in services including aircraft brokerage, management and financing. Harding had undertaken a series of record-breaking challenges that led him to the depths of the ocean and around the world. He also went to space on a Blue Origin flight last year.</p><p>Another passenger, Paul-Henry Nargeolet, was considered a leading authority on the Titanic wreck, according to the website of Experiential Media Group. The Georgia-based company lists Nargeolet as its director of underwater research. </p><p>Nargeolet spent 22 years in the French Navy, rising to the rank of commander. He completed more than three dozen dives to the site of the wreckage. </p><p>OceanGate’s founder and chief executive, Stockton Rush, was also aboard the submersible, according to a spokesman for the company.</p><p><strong>What is OceanGate Expeditions?</strong></p><p>Rush founded OceanGate in 2009, saying in a speech last year that he wanted to expand deep-sea exploration. </p><p>The Washington-based firm owns three submersibles, including the Titan, that have completed more than 200 deep-sea dives, according to the company’s website. OceanGate completed two trips to the Titanic wreck in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>This year’s expedition was slated to last 10 days, with eight days at sea. Stefan Williams, a professor of marine robotics at the University of Sydney, said it takes about two hours to travel from the surface of the ocean to the wreckage in the submersible. </p><p>OceanGate, a privately owned company, lists six board members, including Rush, on its website. The other members include an astronaut and a financial executive.</p><p>Tourists can pay $250,000 to join an expedition to see the Titanic.</p><p><strong>What documents did passengers sign?</strong></p><p>Past travelers on the Titan said they signed a waiver before boarding that mentioned the risk of death at least three times.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>submersible 潜水器，深潜器</p><p>vessel 容器，器皿；船，舰</p><p>wreck 破坏，损坏；沉船，严重损毁的交通工具</p><p>kick off 开球，开始</p><p>debris 碎片，残渣</p><p>catastrophic 灾难性的；失败的</p><p>chamber 会议室；腔，膛；议院</p><p>bow 鞠躬；船头，舰首；蝴蝶结</p><p>nose cone 航天器，飞机或导弹的锥头</p><p>hull 船体</p><p>instantaneous 即刻的，瞬时的</p><p>converge 趋同；汇聚，集中</p><p>comb 梳子；仔细搜查</p><p>bang重击，发出巨响</p><p>piece sth together 拼合，凑集</p><p>implode 内爆；崩溃</p><p>acoustic 声音的，听觉的</p><p>submarine 潜艇</p><p>voyage 航海，航行</p><p>conglomerate 企业集团</p><p>fertilizer 肥料</p><p>aviator 飞行员</p><p>on board 在船上</p><p>brokerage 经纪商</p><p>wreckage 残骸</p><p>expedition 探险，考察</p><p>slate 预定，计划，安排；候选名单</p><p>waiver 弃权声明书</p></blockquote>]]></content>

It showed Zhang’s confrontation with the man, who Chinese media outlets identified by his last name, Deng. </p><p>“Hello. May I see your phone to check if you took photos of me?” she asked Zhang.</p><p>Appearing confused, the man immediately opened his photo gallery and showed that it did not have any photos of Zhang or anyone on the subway.</p><p>“Watch it. Don’t carelessly take photos of others,” Zhang told him before leaving.</p><p>Zhang gets blasted online and quickly goes viral</p><p>As Zhang’s video and accusations about the man’s conduct spread, she started getting slammed on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.</p><p>“If you suspect that I’ve done something wrong, shouldn’t you show evidence that I’ve done so? Why do I need to prove my innocence? Report it to the police and let them figure it out,” said one Weibo user.</p><p>“The most hateful thing about this woman is that after she clearly reconciled the situation, she posted something on the internet to make others go viral,” wrote another.</p><p>On Monday, the local broadsheet Qilu Evening News published an interview with Deng’s son, who said his father was a migrant worker visiting the city on his off day when he was confronted by Zhang on the subway.</p><p>Deng’s son said his family went to the police over the weekend to mediate the dispute between Zhang and the migrant worker. He told Qilu Evening News that the family, at the time, was unaware of the video that was already circulating on Weibo.</p><p>After finding out about the Weibo post, Deng’s son told local reporters that his family intended to sue Zhang if she didn’t apologize.</p><p>Zhang has since issued a public apology on her Weibo account. “Sir, I’m sorry, I was really wrong. I shouldn’t have spread this video on the internet even after confirming your innocence,” she wrote on Sunday evening.</p><p>“I sincerely acknowledge that this incident has caused serious harm to you and your family, and I solemnly express my deep apologies to you and your family,” she added.</p><p>Zhang did not immediately respond to Insider’s request for comment.</p><p>The backlash has intensified to the point that its top state media outlets are getting involved in the fracas</p><p>The university student’s accusations have gone viral on Weibo, with hashtags related to her post being viewed nearly 1 billion times, per data seen by Insider.</p><p>Even the Ministry of Public Security jumped in, posting on Monday that people should seek help from police first when facing potential criminal issues that are “difficult to judge and deal with.”</p><p>Meanwhile, people have called for Zhang to be charged in court for false accusations, and expelled from her school, Sichuan University. Unverified details about her life and relationships with her college classmates also went viral.</p><p>Deng’s son told local media that his family has chosen to forgive Zhang. “We’ve already said that as long as she apologizes, we’ll forgive her and give her a chance,” he said.</p><p>The People’s Daily, a Chinese state media outlet, published a commentary on Wednesday calling for the public to calm down and stop doxxing Zhang.</p><p>“Many people continue to obsess over the consequences faced by this woman. But in the process, some have exposed her name, age, school, major, and other personal information, and others found her personal social account, and others insulted, abused her, and condemned her endlessly,” it wrote. “These are signs of cyberbullying.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>eviscerate 切除···的内脏；重创（组织或体系的）元气</p><p>maelstorm 骚乱，极度混乱</p><p>upskirt 偷拍</p><p>squat 蹲，蹲坐</p><p>wretched 苦恼的，不幸的；讨厌的，该死的</p><p>tactic 策略，手法</p><p>caption 说明文字</p><p>viral 病毒式传播</p><p>debunk 驳斥，揭穿，揭露···的真相</p><p>blast 爆破，网爆；抨击，严厉批评</p><p>slam 砰地关上；严厉批评</p><p>reconcile 调和，调解，使一致</p><p>broadsheet 大幅报纸，大幅广告</p><p>mediate 调解</p><p>circulate 循环，流通，传递</p><p>solemnly 庄严地，严肃地</p><p>backlash 强烈抵制，集体反对</p><p>fracas 高声争吵，激烈打斗</p><p>hashtag 社交媒体上描述主题的#</p><p>expel 开除，驱逐，除名</p><p>doxx 人肉搜索</p><p>obsess 着迷，困扰，牵挂</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Alibaba is in the process of splitting itself into six independently run companies that could seek separate initial public offerings, a move that would break up the business empire that co-founder Jack Ma had built over two decades.</p><p>Eddie Wu, who heads the Taobao and Tmall domestic e-commerce business, will succeed Zhang as chief executive and replace Zhang on the board, the company said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>Tsai—born in Taiwan and a graduate of Yale University—and Wu are both company veterans who have been with Alibaba since 1999 and, together with Ma, helped develop the group’s business strategies and corporate culture. </p><p>A decade ago, Wu, who is a less-known co-founder led the company’s strategy to develop and give priority to its smartphone shopping sites as consumers shifted to using the mobile internet. </p><p>Zhang is currently heading Alibaba’s cloud-computing unit and will continue to do so, Alibaba said in its statement.</p><p>“It is the right time for me to dedicate my full attention and time to the [cloud] business,” Zhang said in a letter to employees that was seen by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>In May, Alibaba said it planned to fully spin off its cloud business and complete its public listing in the next 12 months. It didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Zhang’s letter.</p><p>Ma, the billionaire co-founder, was recently in Hangzhou, where Alibaba is based. On Saturday, he attended an annual global mathematics competition that he started in 2018 and chatted with the finalists, according to a statement by Alibaba’s research unit. </p><p>Ma remains the biggest shareholder of Alibaba and still cares very much about the company, Michael Evans, Alibaba’s president, said at a technology event in Paris last week.</p><p>Alibaba has been grappling with sluggish growth, facing a cooling economy and rising competition from homegrown upstarts such as PDD Holding’s Pinduoduo e-commerce platform and ByteDance’s Douyin short-video platform.</p><p>In the January-to-March quarter, Alibaba posted the slowest revenue growth for the second straight quarter since it went public in 2014.</p><p>Alibaba listed in New York following a blockbuster IPO that remains one of the world’s largest-ever stock sales. Zhang was promoted from chief operating officer to CEO the following year and became the company’s executive chairman in 2019 when Ma stepped down. </p><p>Under Zhang, Alibaba was for a time China’s most valuable publicly listed company, with a market capitalization that topped $850 billion at its peak in October 2020. Alibaba was subsequently hit with a record $2.8 billion antitrust fine.</p><p>Its shares have lost close to $600 billion in market value from their record high and briefly fell below their New York IPO price last year. Longtime shareholder SoftBank Group of Japan recently unwound its stake in Alibaba. </p><p>Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares were 1.6% lower in Tuesday afternoon trading after the company mapped out its leadership succession plan.</p><p>Alibaba’s restructuring culminates a yearslong shift inside the company to make it more nimble. Alibaba’s various businesses will be split up into six major areas: cloud computing, Chinese e-commerce, global e-commerce, digital mapping and food delivery, logistics, and media and entertainment.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>veteran 老手，经验丰富的人；老兵，退伍军人</p><p>giant 巨头，大公司</p><p>grapple with 扭打，搏斗；努力设法解决，设法对付，尽量克服</p><p>stock 库存，存货；股份，股票</p><p>reshuffle 改组</p><p>undergo 经历，经受</p><p>succeed 继任，接替</p><p>board 董事会；上船，上飞机</p><p>spin sth off 派生出，衍生出；将···分离出来</p><p>list 上市</p><p>finalist 决赛选手</p><p>sluggish 萧条的，迟钝的，行动缓慢的，迟缓的，缺乏活力的，性能欠佳的</p><p>upstart 新出现的竞争者；暴发户</p><p>post 职位，职务；帖子；公布公司财务结果</p><p>go public 公开，公之于众；公开发售股票，上市</p><p>blockbuster 轰动，巨型炸弹，轰动一时的书籍&#x2F;电影</p><p>step down 退位</p><p>antitrust 反垄断的</p><p>unwind 解开，打开，松开；放松，轻松</p><p>map sth out 详细安排，筹划</p><p>culminate 以···告终，达到···的顶点</p><p>nimble 灵活的，敏捷的，机敏的</p><p>logistics 后勤，物流工作</p></blockquote>]]></content>

The CEO of Alibaba’s e-commerce business unit, Trudy Dai, also previously pledged to make “huge, historic” investments to attract users to its platforms.</p><p>“For months, Chinese consumers have been price-conscious, looking for deals and trading down across most product categories,” Rein said.</p><p>This year, for the first time, JD.com did not reveal its total sales numbers for the 618 event, despite saying in a blog post that the 2023 shopping extravaganza had “exceeded expectations, setting a new record.”</p><p>JD.com said in a blog post that during the 618 shopping festival, consumers snapped up 10 times the number of products that were eligible under its “10-billion-yuan subsidies” program, compared to March.</p><p>Despite overall soft consumption, categories like cosmetics and luxury goods saw a bigger uptick in sales compared to the previous quarter, according to Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC.</p><p>For this year’s 618 event, more luxury brands took part as they sought to boost sales in China after the sector in 2022 declined for the first time in five years.</p><p>Brands like Moncler and Lemaire took part in 618 on Tmall for the first time.</p><p>Many luxury brands also took the opportunity to launch new products online, with some offering rare discounts and other incentives such as interest-free payment in instalments over 12 months.</p><p>Brands like Burberry, Chloe and Miu Miu’s sales in the first 30 minutes of the 618 festival at the end of May had exceeded its total sales during the shopping festival a year ago, according to Tmall data.</p><p>“Luxury coming back online is a big trend,” said Cooke. “Some brands may see up to a 10-fold increase in sales over last year.”</p><p><strong>JD.com sales during China shopping festival better than expected -analysts</strong></p><p><strong>From: Reuters</strong></p><p>Sales on JD.com e-commerce site during China’s mid-year shopping festival grew more than expected, brokerages said.</p><p>JD.com saw sales rise 6-8% over the 618 festival period that ran from late May through to Sunday evening, according to a client note from Citi analysts. That beat Citi’s expectations of 2-5% growth.</p><p>That estimate was, however, still less than 10.3% growth for JD.com’s gross merchandising value (GMV) logged last year and 27.7% growth in 2021.</p><p>The festival, named after the founding date of JD.com but embraced by all e-commerce platforms, is a key barometer of Chinese consumer spending.</p><p>JD.com has said it will not release its GMV figures for the festival period this year, only noting that sales hit a record - a milestone which was expected. Alibaba has also stopped releasing GMV figures for the so-called Singles Day shopping festival period in November in the face of slowing sales.</p><p>The festival period this year was marked by fierce competition, with platforms offering billions of yuan in coupons and subsidies to entice Chinese consumers to spend.</p><p>Retail sales climbed 12.7% in May, missing a consensus estimate of 13.6% growth and slowing from 18.4% growth in April.</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client note said JD.com sales during 618 “slightly” exceeded expectations, while Jefferies analysts said the event “surpassed expectations and set new records.” Neither provided numerical estimates.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>snap sth up 抢购一空</p><p>merchant 商人，批发商</p><p>slash 大幅削减，大幅减少</p><p>steep 大起大落的；陡峭的</p><p>shore sth up 支撑，改善，提高</p><p>retailer 零售商</p><p>barometer 晴雨表，标志，指标</p><p>incentive 刺激，激励</p><p>subsidies 补贴，津贴</p><p>rival 竞争对手；比得上</p><p>pledge 承诺，保证；保证给予；抵押；誓言，诺言</p><p>price-conscious 价格敏感的</p><p>trade down 买更便宜东东西</p><p>extravaganza 盛大表演</p><p>exceed 超过，超出</p><p>eligible 合格的，有资格的；合适的</p><p>cosmetics 化妆品，美容品；装饰门面的，表面的</p><p>uptick 增长，发展，上升</p><p>consultancy 咨询公司，咨询服务</p><p>interest-free 无息</p><p>instalment 分期付款</p><p>brokerage 经纪商</p><p>gross 令人不快的，令人恶心的；严重的，极端的；毛的，总的，总共，全部</p><p>milestone 里程碑，转折点，重大事件</p><p>coupon 优惠券</p><p>entice 诱惑，诱使</p><p>consensus  一致的意见，共识</p><p>surpass 优于，超过</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Those who have had limited contact with little ones might interpret this word-combination as implying deep and prolonged slumber. For others, this union of words may elicit memories of prolonged periods of chaotic sleep (or what can feel like no sleep at all).</p><p>Coping with the way babies sleep can be difficult. It’s not that babies don’t sleep. In fact, they sleep more than at any other stage of life. It’s more an issue of when they sleep. Newborns start by sleeping and waking around the clock. This is not always easy for parents. There is even research suggesting that in adults waking repeatedly at night can feel as bad as getting hardly any sleep in terms of attentional skills, fatigue levels and symptoms of depression.</p><p>As to why infants wake at night, this is best explained by thinking about the two things that govern our sleep: the homeostatic and circadian processes. The crux of the homeostatic process is the straightforward idea that the longer we have been awake the greater our sleep drive (and the more sleepy we feel). It may take an adult an entire day to build up enough sleep drive to fall asleep at bedtime, but an infant may only need an hour or two of wakefulness before being able to drift off to sleep.</p><p>The second process is circadian, which works like a clock. Adults typically feel more awake during the morning hours and sleepy at night, regardless of when we last slept. In very young babies this process is not yet developed. This means that sleep is more likely to occur at different points across the 24-hour day.</p><p>Practically speaking, the immaturity of these two processes mean that that newborn babies are actually expected to wake at night: they are doing exactly what they are supposed to do! They start life with small stomachs which need to be filled regularly so you child can gain strength and stay hydrated, so it’s a good thing that they are waking regularly to feed. As hard as disturbed sleep can be for caregivers, a waking baby is a good thing.</p><p>But how long might this continue? The parenting mantra “this too shall pass” is true when it comes to dealing with certain aspects of a baby’s sleep. Night wakings typically become less frequent as an infant ages, and sleep changes in other ways throughout a person’s life. For example, sleep length reduces and there are changes in sleep architecture (or composition of Rapid Eye Movement, REM, and Non-Rapid Eye Movement, NREM, sleep). A premature baby’s sleep cycle might take just 45 minutes, whereas an adult’s can be double that at 90 minutes. Other changes also occur; for example, whereas babies’ sleep cycles start with REM-like sleep, adults start with NREM sleep.</p><p>For some parents, knowing that sleep changes throughout life is enough to help them cope with an infant’s night awakenings. In fact, sleep education alone can help some parents to deal with infant sleep. Other parents want more detailed information, such as about babies’ sleep schedules, bedtime routines, sleep problems, sleep safety, sleep environment, naps, sleep training, and special circumstances. We provide all this information, and more, on our website, where physicians, psychologists, and researchers from the Pediatric Sleep Council have also answered hundreds of questions about sleep via video and text. In addition, on Baby Sleep Day, we will be available to answer your individual questions via our Facebook page.</p><p>Remember: sleep matters. Experts agree that sleep is essential for health, growth and general development. It is important not just for babies, but for parents too. If we can improve sleep within a family, and create a happy association between the words “baby” and “sleep”, then the Pediatric Sleep Council and Baby Sleep Day have achieved their goal.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>evoke 唤起，引起</p><p>interpret 诠释，说明；把···理解为，领会；演绎；翻译，口译</p><p>prolonged 长期的</p><p>slumber 睡觉，睡眠</p><p>elicit 引出，探出，诱出</p><p>chaotic 混乱的，毫无秩序的</p><p>around the clock 全天候的</p><p>fatigue 疲劳，劳累</p><p>homeostatic 体内动态平衡</p><p>circadian 昼夜的，约一日的</p><p>crux 关键，核心，症结</p><p>drift off 渐渐入睡</p><p>immaturity 不成熟，幼稚；发育未全，未成熟</p><p>hydrated 摄入足够水分的；脱水的，极度干渴的</p><p>mantra 准则；老话，口头禅，口号</p><p>composition 成分，构成，结构</p><p>premature 过早的，不成熟的，仓促的</p><p>pediatric 小儿科的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

The team, assembled posthaste after public outcry, has now confirmed that an aberrant item found in a college canteen dish was, in fact, the severed head of a rat, and not a duck neck as was initially asserted by local authorities.</p><p>Comprising representatives from an assortment of government bodies – including education, public security, and market supervision and regulation authorities – the ad hoc team embarked upon their quest for truth when the local market watchdog’s conclusions were besieged by a torrent of skepticism and vitriol online.</p><p>In a meticulous, almost forensic examination of the canteen’s surveillance footage, the investigation team unearthed damning evidence: the contentious object was discarded by canteen staff on the day of the discovery. An assiduous round of interviews ensued, encompassing not only canteen and kitchen overseers but also the unsuspecting student who stumbled upon the ghastly find and the cohort of witnesses to the incident.</p><p>A coterie of zoology savants, enlisted to analyze photographs and video footage furnished by the student, delivered the conclusion: the object was unequivocally identified as the decapitated head of a rodent, likely a rat.</p><p>The college and the market oversight authority of Gaoxin district, Nanchang, are implicated in a dereliction of duty. Their reckless dismissal of empirical evidence and subsequent dissemination of an erroneous narrative was unequivocally condemned by the task force. In a veritable hammer blow, the canteen’s operating certificate has been suspended, and the parent company, along with its legal custodian, has been saddled with the apogee of punitive measures.</p><p>In tandem, the college and the district market watchdog have been served with statutory penalties. Furthermore, a sweeping campaign to bolster food safety standards is set to cascade through Jiangxi Province.</p><p>In the aftermath, the college expediently purged from its website an earlier communique that mendaciously identified the object as a duck neck.</p><p>Observers laud the indefatigable diligence and integrity displayed by the task force in unearthing the truth. Concurrently, they implore a solemn introspection into the murky motivations that possibly underpinned the perfunctory and misleading narrative initially advanced by the college and the local market watchdog. It is imperative, they argue, to meticulously ascertain and address the root causes behind such ignoble deeds.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>unveil 为···揭幕，揭开面纱；首次展示，介绍，推出，将···公之于众</p><p>prompt 促使，导致；提词，提白；提示符</p><p>revolting 令人讨厌的</p><p>assemble 聚集，聚合；组装，装配</p><p>posthaste 尽快地，急忙地</p><p>outcry 呐喊，大声疾呼</p><p>aberrant 反常的，异常的</p><p>sever 中断，分开</p><p>assert 断言，主张；维护自己的权力</p><p>comprise 包含，由···组成</p><p>assortment 各种各样</p><p>ad hoc 特别的，临时的</p><p>embark upon 开始，着手做</p><p>quest 追求，寻求，探索</p><p>watchdog 监督人，监察委员会</p><p>besiege 围攻，围困，烦扰，使应接不暇</p><p>torrent 激流，迸发，狂潮</p><p>meticulous 严谨的，一丝不苟的</p><p>forensic 法医的</p><p>unearth 挖掘，发掘；（经努力）发现</p><p>damning 毫不留情的，谴责的，证据确凿的</p><p>contentious 引起争议的</p><p>assiduous 专心致志的，兢兢业业的，勤勉的</p><p>ensue 接着发生</p><p>encompass 包含，包括</p><p>stumble 犯错，失足；踉跄，绊脚</p><p>ghastly 可怕的，令人震惊的</p><p>cohort 有共同特点的一群人</p><p>coterie 小圈子，小团体</p><p>savant 专家，学者</p><p>enlist 谋求（某人的帮助）</p><p>unequivocally 明确地，肯定地</p><p>decapitate 把···斩首</p><p>rodent 啮齿动物</p><p>implicate 牵涉，涉及</p><p>dereliction 玩忽职守</p><p>reckless 鲁莽的，轻率的</p><p>empirical 经验主义的</p><p>dissemination 传播，散布</p><p>veritable 十足的，不折不扣的</p><p>suspend 暂停；暂令停职，暂令停学</p><p>custodian 监护人，监管人，看护人，保管人</p><p>saddle sb with sth 使某人负担，使某人承担</p><p>apogee 顶峰，顶点，最高点</p><p>in tandem 协同地，联合地，同时</p><p>statutory 法定的</p><p>sweeping  影响广泛的，大范围的，根本性的，意义深远的；泛泛之谈</p><p>cascade 大量倾泄；逐层传递，传播，传达</p><p>expediently 方便地，权宜地</p><p>purge 清除，清洗，肃清</p><p>communique 公报</p><p>mendaciously 撒谎地</p><p>laud 称赞，赞美</p><p>implore 哀求某人，恳求得到某物</p><p>introspection 反省</p><p>murky 黑暗的，不清楚的，肮脏的；复杂难懂的</p><p>underpin 加强，加固</p><p>perfunctory 草率的，马虎的，敷衍的</p><p>imperative 迫切的，紧急的，至关重要的</p><p>ascertain 弄清，查明</p><p>ignoble 卑鄙的，可耻的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Argentina friendly match in Beijing on Thursday, an enthusiastic Chinese fan stormed the field in an attempt to hug soccer legend Lionel Messi.</p><p>Video from the game shows the unidentified fan rush up and embrace Messi, while being chased all over the field by security. The crowd in the stadium can be heard shouting Chinese phrases that sort of translate to “Awesome!” and “Badass!”</p><p>The invader managed to high-five one of the goalies before finally being apprehended by security, but did not lose his gleeful smile even as he was being carried out.</p><p>In an interview with Messi’s fan club, he apologized for his behavior, while criticizing the security measures.</p><p>“Of course, I also hope to use my negative case to tell the security personnel that your security work is not competent and gave me such an opportunity,” he said. “There will be many international competitions in Beijing in the future. I hope you will improve your security capabilities.”</p><p>Chinese state media widely covered “Messi mania,” with the Global Times tabloid reporting that fans from across the country had flocked to Beijing just to get a glimpse of the soccer star.</p><p>The tabloid also reported that hotel prices near the stadium have soared to over $1,000 USD per night, and scams claiming to give fans an opportunity to meet Messi have proliferated in recent days.</p><p>In Argentina, many see the match as an economic incentive to boost business ties with China. Combined with another upcoming friendly match against Indonesia’s national team in Jakarta, the Argentina Football Association will ultimately pocket $6 million USD for the matches, La Nacion newspaper reports.</p><p>But the association is also hoping to finalize a deal to open two Football Technological Institutes in China’s Guangxi and Jiangsu provinces, the paper reports, which will employ the same coaching methods used in Buenos Aires.</p><p><strong>Moment a pitch invader breaks through guards and rushes onto the pitch to hug Lionel Messi during Socceroos’ Beijing game - before slamming security for being useless</strong></p><p><strong>From: Daily Mail</strong></p><p>A football fan managed to meet his idol Lionel Messi in the flesh in China - but how he went about it has raised security concerns.</p><p>The supporter burst onto the pitch at the Workers’ Stadium in Beijing and hugged his hero while wearing the iconic Argentina number 10 jersey.</p><p>In comical scenes, he went onto high-five goalkeeper Emi Martinez before eventually being nabbed by security during the friendly against the Socceroos.</p><p>Footage shows the man being carried away from the venue.</p><p>The pitch invader later apologised for his conduct - but not before criticising security for being slow to act.</p><p>‘I hope to use my negative case to tell the security personnel that your security work is not competent and gave me such an opportunity,’ he said.</p><p>‘There will be many international competitions in Beijing in the future.

Paris is trying to find out"></a><strong>Can humans and rats live together? Paris is trying to find out</strong></h1><hr><p>Can humans and rats live together?</p><p>That’s what city leaders in Paris are trying to find out. The French capital, like many metropolises, has a notorious rodent problem.</p><p>Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo is forming a committee to study “cohabitation” – to what extent humans and rodents can live together – one of her deputies said Thursday during a city council meeting.</p><p>Anne Souyris, Paris’ deputy mayor in charge of public health, announced the move in response to questions from Geoffroy Boulard, the head of Paris’ 17th arrondissement and a member of the center-right Republican party.</p><p>Boulard had called upon the city government to outline a more ambitious plan against the proliferation of rats in public spaces.</p><p>He has previously criticized Hidalgo, a member of the center-left socialist party, for not doing enough to eliminate rats from Paris, including during strikes earlier this year which saw garbage pile up across the city.</p><p>“The presence of rats on the surface is harmful to the quality of life of Parisians,” Boulard said.</p><p>Boulard said he was raising his question after coming across an ongoing study, Project Armageddon. The project’s mission is aiding the city in managing its rat population and among its objectives is fighting prejudices against rats to help Parisians better live with them.</p><p>The study is being financed by the French government, though the city of Paris is a partner in the project.</p><p>Souyris explained that what was being studied was to what extent humans and rats can live together in a way that is “the most efficient and at the same time ensures that it’s not unbearable for Parisians.”</p><p>While rats can spread disease, the deputy mayor said that the rats being discussed were not the same black rats that can carry plague, but other types of rats that carry diseases like leptospirosis, a bacterial disease. Souyris also highlighted some of the actions taken by the city as part of its 2017 anti-rat plan, including investing in thousands of new garbage cans to “make the rats go back underground.”</p><p>Souyris later said on Twitter that Paris’ rats do not pose a “significant” public health risk. She added that she was asking the French High Council on Public Health to weigh in on the debate.</p><p>“We need scientific advice, not political press releases,” she said.</p><p>Animal rights group Paris Animaux Zoopolis welcomed the city’s move.</p><p>“Rats are present in Paris, as in all major French cities, so the question of cohabitation necessarily arises,” a statement from the group said.</p><p>“At PAZ, when we talk about “peaceful cohabitation” with rats, we don’t mean living with them in our houses and apartments, but making sure that these animals don’t suffer AND that we’re not disturbed. Again, a very reasonable objective!”</p><p>CNN has asked the Paris authorities for more detail on the plans.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>rat 老鼠</p><p>metropolis 大城市，首都</p><p>notorious 声名狼藉的，臭名昭著的</p><p>rodent 啮齿动物</p><p>cohabitation 同居</p><p>deputy 代理人，副职，副手；议员</p><p>arrocdissement 区</p><p>outline 概括，略述</p><p>proliferation 扩散，激增，涌现，大量的事物</p><p>pile up 成为一堆，把···堆积起来</p><p>Armageddon 大规模战争，大决战</p><p>aid 帮助，援助</p><p>objective 目标，目的；客观的，就事论事的，不带个人感情的</p><p>prejudice 偏见</p><p>plague 鼠疫，瘟疫</p><p>bacterial 细菌的</p><p>can 金属罐</p><p>pose 姿势；造成，引起；提出，质询</p><p>weigh in 在讨论中发表有分量的意见，发挥作用</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>6月13日，浙江杭州西兴大桥，一名年轻女子跳桥轻生，正在配送路上的外卖小哥彭清林紧跟着从10余米高的桥上一跃而下，把女子从死亡边缘拉了回来。</p></blockquote><h1 id="Physicists-calculate-highest-dives-most-humans-can-safely-withstand"><a href="#Physicists-calculate-highest-dives-most-humans-can-safely-withstand" class="headerlink" title="Physicists calculate highest dives most humans can safely withstand"></a><strong>Physicists calculate highest dives most humans can safely withstand</strong></h1><hr><p>By using 3D-printed models and dropping them into a tank, researchers have found the maximum heights people can dive from before they will encounter forces that can cause injury</p><p>How high would you dare to dive from? An experiment with 3D-printed models has discovered how high people can leap from into water without serious risk of injury.</p><p>Sunghwan Jung at Cornell University in New York and his colleagues studied the forces experienced when slamming into water by dropping 3D-printed models representing different human postures into a tank. One represented a person diving head first with their hands by their sides, one a person with their hands above their head and their palms touching, and another was just a leg with a foot representing jumping in feet first. Each model was equipped with a force sensor and was filmed with a high-speed camera when dropped.</p><p>To determine unsafe heights for diving, the researchers compared the forces they recorded to those known to cause physical damage to people. They found that those force levels were met for head-first divers above 8 metres, hands-first divers above 12 metres and foot-first divers above 15 metres.</p><p>Jung says that most of the force affecting the body while diving is due to the displacement of water. It is like pushing your fingers very quickly into a jar of honey – the liquid forcefully resists, he says.</p><p>People have successfully dived from much higher heights than the limits found in the study. For example, Laso Schaller broke the record for the highest feet-first dive in 2015 when he jumped from 58.8 metres above water. Jung says that to execute such extreme jumps without injury, divers must flex the right muscles to make their bodies stiffer and tighter.</p><p>Head and neck injuries often happen when dives go wrong, and shoulder and lower back injuries are common in divers more generally, says Nathaniel Jones at the Loyola University Medical Center in Illinois. “Springboard divers average 100 to 150 dives per day and platform divers 50 to 100 dives per day. Doing so many dives puts them at risk through multiple injury opportunities,” he says.</p><p>Jung says that his team wants to experiment with differently shaped models for dives into snow rather than water, such as those that some foxes perform.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>physicist 物理学家</p><p>tank 坦克；表现糟糕，快速减少，衰落，下降；水箱，水槽</p><p>dive 跳水，下潜</p><p>dive in&#x2F;into sth 贸然投入到···之中；介入，一心投入，钻研</p><p>encounter 遭遇；偶然相遇；邂逅，不期而遇</p><p>force 力量，暴力，武力；强迫，迫使</p><p>leap 跳，跳跃；激增，提高，猛涨</p><p>slam 严厉批评，猛烈抨击；重重撞上，砰地关上</p><p>sensor 传感器</p><p>diver 跳水运动员，潜水员</p><p>displacement 排水量；被迫移居他乡</p><p>jar 罐子，坛子</p><p>resist 抵挡，抵制；按捺，忍住</p><p>flex 活动（手臂、腿等）；使（肌肉）绷紧</p><p>stiff 不易弯曲的，硬的，挺的；僵硬的，强直的</p><p>springboard 跳板</p></blockquote>]]></content>

They were also asked to report any psychiatric diagnoses. Researchers conducted mediation analyses to determine how the factors influenced each other.</p><p>“We found time monitoring behavior mainly has an effect on sleep medication use because it exacerbates insomnia symptoms,” Dawson said. “People are concerned that they’re not getting enough sleep, then they start estimating how long it will take them to fall back asleep and when they have to be up. That is not the sort of activity that’s helpful in facilitating the ability to fall asleep – the more stressed out you are, the harder time you’re going to have falling asleep.”</p><p>As the frustration over sleeplessness grows, people are more likely to use sleep aids in an attempt to gain control over their sleep.</p><p>The results are published in The Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders.</p><p>Dawson said the research indicates a simple behavioral intervention could provide help for those struggling with insomnia. He gives the same advice to every new patient the first time they meet.</p><p>“One thing that people could do would be to turn around or cover up their clock, <em>ditch the smart watch, get the phone away</em> so they’re simply not checking the time,” Dawson said. “There’s not any place where watching the clock is particularly helpful.”</p><p>With 15 years of of research and clinical experience in the sleep field, Dawson is interested in comparing individuals’ sleeping experiences with what is concurrently happening in their brains. He trains and supervises doctoral students in the Department of Psychological and Brain Science’s Clinical Science Program.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>exacerbate 使恶化，使加剧</p><p>insomnia 失眠</p><p>clinical 门诊的，临床的</p><p>psychological 心灵的，心理的，精神上的</p><p>cardiovascular 心血管的</p><p>severity 严重</p><p>medication 药物 </p><p>monitor 监视，检查</p><p>psychiatric 精神病学的</p><p>mediation analyse 中介效应分析</p><p>mediation 调停，调解</p><p>facilitate 促进，促使</p><p>disorder 混乱，凌乱；失调</p><p>ditch 沟渠；抛弃</p><p>concurrently 并发地，同时发生地，并存地</p><p>supervise 监督</p></blockquote>]]></content>

While most people’s estimates were too high or too low — falling an average of 37 lbs. away from the true weight of 1,198 lbs. — the median of everyone’s guess was off by only 9 lbs., or less than 1 percent of the true weight of the ox.</p><p>This example illustrates what has come to be known as the “wisdom of crowds” effect. In some cases, the average of a large number of independent estimates can be quite accurate, even when the estimators have no special expertise.</p><p>“The average competitor,” Galton wrote of the ox competition, “was probably as well fitted for making a just estimate of the dressed weight of the ox, as an average voter is of judging the merits of most political issues on which he votes.”</p><p>The wisdom of crowds capitalizes on the fact that when people make errors, those errors aren’t always the same. Some people will tend to overestimate, and some to underestimate. When enough of these errors are averaged together, they cancel each other out, resulting in a more accurate estimate. That’s why the effect benefits from a large and diverse “crowd.” If people are similar in the sense that they tend to make the same errors, then their errors won’t cancel each other out. A crowd with many overestimators will yield a global average that still falls too high; a crowd with many underestimators will yield a global average that still falls too low.</p><p>In more technical terms, the wisdom of crowds requires that people’s estimates be independent. Studies have found that when people can observe the estimates of others, the accuracy of the crowd typically goes down. People’s errors become correlated or dependent, and are less likely to cancel each other out. We follow our peers, to the detriment of the performance of the group.</p><p>But a new paper offers an interesting twist on this classic phenomenon. When crowds are further subdivided into smaller “crowds” that are allowed to deliberate about the right answer, they not only succeed in overcoming the costs of introducing dependence, but even outperform the group as a whole.</p><p>The new paper, published last month in Nature Human Behavior and authored by Joaquin Navajas and colleagues, reports the results of a large-scale study of estimation. More than 4,000 people attending an event were asked to provide estimates for eight values, such as the height of the Eiffel Tower. They were then subdivided into groups of five estimators and encouraged to discuss half of the eight values to arrive at a consensus estimate for the group.</p><p>The key finding was that the averages from these “deliberating crowds” of five were more accurate than those from an equal number of independent individuals. For instance, the average obtained from the estimates of four deliberating groups of five was significantly more accurate than the average obtained from 20 independent individuals. In fact, averaging four deliberating groups resulted in a more accurate estimate than averaging 1,400 individual estimates.</p><p>These benefits were not observed for the estimated values that were not discussed by the group, so they somehow derived from the group-level process itself. But what, exactly, were the groups doing to achieve this impressive effect?</p><p>In a follow-up study with 100 university students, the researchers tried to get a better sense of what the deliberating crowds actually did. Did they tend to go with the answers of those who were most confident about their estimates? Did they gravitate towards the answers of those least willing to change their minds? This happened some of the time, but it wasn’t the dominant response. Most frequently, the groups reported that they “shared arguments and reasoned together.” Somehow, these arguments and reasoning resulted in a global reduction in error, rather than introducing correlated errors that undermined the wisdom of crowds.</p><p>The new paper by Navajas and colleagues reports only two studies, one large and one small, and it focuses exclusively on estimates concerning trivia or general knowledge. As a result, many questions remain. But the potential implications for group decision-making and deliberation are enormous. If a small number of deliberating groups can outperform a much larger number of individuals, this suggests that procedures like “deliberative polling” could be a promising strategy for public and private communities to pursue.</p><p>Galton introduced his 1907 paper by noting that “[i]n these democratic days, any investigation into the trustworthiness and peculiarities of popular judgments is of interest.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>statistician 统计学家</p><p>peculiar 奇怪的，独特的</p><p>country fair 美国每年夏季的县集市</p><p>estimate 估计，估算，估价</p><p>median 中位数</p><p>expertise 专长，专门技能</p><p>dressed weight 可用于食用的肉的量</p><p>merit 优点，价值，功绩</p><p>capitalize on sth 利用···获益；从···中获利；充分利用；借助于</p><p>cancel sth out 抵消</p><p>diverse 多种多样的</p><p>yield 产生；放弃，让出（常指被迫）</p><p>detriment 危害</p><p>twist 转变，转折</p><p>subdivide 细分</p><p>deliberate 深思熟虑；有意的，故意的</p><p>consensus 一致的意见，共识</p><p>derive 从···中得到</p><p>follow-up 后续行动，后续事物；后续的，进一步的</p><p>gravitate 吸引到；受吸引而转到</p><p>dominant 首要的，占支配地位的，显著的；显性的；优势的</p><p>reason 推理，判断（作动词）</p><p>trivia 琐事</p><p>implication 暗示，含意；可能的影响</p><p>outperform 超过，胜过；比···做的好</p><p>peculiarity 古怪，奇异，怪癖；特点</p></blockquote>]]></content>

And according to some psychologists, in addition to aging, the way we interact with technology could also have a profound effect on the way we experience time.</p><p>Sitting in front of computers all day, we’re constantly confronted by a clock telling us what time it is, and it’s no different whether we’re at home or on the go: 60 percent of Gen Years (ages 18-30) find themselves compulsively or subconsciously checking their smart phones for emails, texts, or social media updates, according to a 2012 Cisco report.</p><p>This ever-present technology is changing not only the way we perceive time, but also the way we think, according to Dr. Philip Zimbardo, professor emeritus of psychology at Stanford and author of The Time Paradox: The New Psychology Of Time That Will Change Your Life.</p><p>The way we perceive and experience time can have a profound psychological effect. Far from being objective, time is, in fact, a highly subjective experience, one that’s subject to technological and cultural influences. From an early age, our highly malleable time perceptions become biased. In The Time Paradox, Zimbardo argues that we all operate from one of three primary time biases. Those who tend to think of their current experiences in terms of what they’ve already experienced are past-oriented, those who focus on the immediate are present-oriented, and those who think in long-term projections are more future-oriented.</p><p>“Time has a powerful effect on our lives that we’re unaware of,” says Zimbardo. “I argue that it’s the most powerful influence on everything we do. It’s so powerful because we get programmed very early in life to be in one of these ‘time zones.’”</p><p>The ideal balance, Zimbardo explains, is to be moderately future-oriented (enough to be motivated to work towards our goals but not so much as to breed workaholism), moderately past-positive (when we look back on our lives, we have a generally positive outlook), and moderately “present hedonistic,” meaning that we take time out for friends, family and fun, but are not so pleasure-oriented as to have addictive tendencies.</p><p>But over-reliance on technology – constantly checking email and social networks, and being distracted by alerts on our mobile devices – can take us out of both the past and the future, and into a state of heightened “present hedonism” in which we’re constantly focused (in a sometimes compulsive way) on what’s either right in front of us or coming immediately afterwards.</p><p>“We’re simply being in that moment to take the next action,” says Zimbardo. “It’s really minimizing the quality of life. It’s minimizing the joy that we ought to be getting from everyday life.”</p><p>Here are things you should know about how technology affects your perception of time.</p><p>Being connected can speed up your sense of time.</p><p>Our constant access to virtually unlimited amounts of news and updates can create a need for immediacy that speeds up both our information intake and our perception of time.</p><p>“Our personal ‘time zone’ can be modified by technology, because it speeds up our internal clock,” says Zimbardo. “Technology makes us impatient for anything that takes more than seconds to achieve. You press a button and you expect instant access … so technology is pushing more and more of us into a very immediately-focused time zone. That means that we tend to ignore the future consequences of our behavior.”</p><p>Because we’re used to being constantly occupied, many of us have a hard time slowing down or waiting. A 2012 Pew survey found that among Millennials, hyper-connectivity can contribute to a need for instant gratification and a lack of patience.</p><p>It can trap us in the ‘next’ moment.</p><p>Technology can trap us in a cycle of instant gratification – we’re stuck in a present moment in which we are not fully present because we’re also anticipating the next moment, Zimbardo explains.</p><p>According to a 2011 Ipsos poll, 27 percent of teens use Facebook continuously throughout the day.</p><p>“They’re constantly checking, hoping that something will be there,” says Zimbardo. “Hope is a very future-oriented thing, but it’s a very short term thing. ‘I hope somebody will see the picture I posted, I hope somebody will respond.’”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>compulsively 强迫性地</p><p>subconsciously 下意识地</p><p>ever-present 始终存在的，永远在场的</p><p>preceive 感知，察觉，注意到，意识到；认为，看待，视为</p><p>emeritus 荣誉退休的</p><p>paradox 悖论</p><p>malleable 可塑的，易受外界影响的</p><p>biased 偏见的，片面的</p><p>-oriented 以···为导向的，以···为目标的</p><p>moderately 适度，适量，适中</p><p>breed 饲养；（动物）交配繁殖；导致</p><p>workahollism 工作狂</p><p>hedonistic 享乐主义的</p><p>minimize 使减到最少，使降到最低限度</p><p>immediacy 即时性</p><p>millennial 千禧年的</p><p>hyper- 超出，过度</p><p>gratification 满足，满意，快感</p><p>trap 被困住，陷入困境</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Users can control the device with their hands and experience movies, TV shows and games in a more immersive way. Cook called it a new “spatial computing” platform.</p><p>Apple shares fell less than 1% after having surged earlier in the day.</p><p>The Vision Pro can project a massive movie screen into any environment for a user, as well as capture or play three-dimensional video, making it possible for a user to watch a movie on a giant screen or interact with life-size personal photos or videos projected into their living environment.</p><p>Apple’s headset launches into an uncertain market for virtual and augmented reality devices. Headset sales grew at a fast clip during the pandemic, doubling to nearly 11 million units shipped in 2021. But they dropped 21% to 8.6 million units in 2022, according to researcher International Data Corp.</p><p>Meta Platforms, which has mostly dominated the market to date with its Quest virtual-reality headsets, has struggled to keep existing users engaged, with more than half of the $400 entry-level Quest headsets not in use six months after they were purchased, The Wall Street Journal reported previously. Last week, Meta said the Meta Quest 3 headset, which the company is promoting as similar to Apple’s Vision Pro, will be available in the fall of this year for $499.</p><p>Apple announced a partnership with Walt Disney, which showed in a pretaped video what viewing experiences could potentially look like, including an immersive Star Wars TV show and a function allowing users to watch multiple sporting events simultaneously. A digital version of the Disneyland theme park could project into the user’s physical world.</p><p>“We’re constantly in search of new ways to entertain, inform and inspire our fans,” Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said in a pretaped video. “We believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary platform.” He said Disney’s streaming service would be available on the device as soon as it reaches users, which Apple said initially would only be in the U.S.</p><p>Apple showed the headset being used in work environments, including an ability to project a screen akin to a modern desktop in a way that could replace a computer monitor. Users can also use Bluetooth devices such as keyboards to type.</p><p>Some features on the device are meant to avoid isolating a user, Apple executives said. Vision Pro displays the user’s eyes on the outside of the device with a screen sitting on the front of the device. And if somebody comes nearby to someone with the headset on, it will show the person.</p><p>The headset will have the M2 chip found in the company’s Macs and will also have a new chip called “R1” for processing data from the many cameras, sensors and microphones in the device. This enables the Vision Pro to limit latency, a common issue in virtual-reality headsets that causes motion sickness. Apple said it would have a high-resolution display system so video would render in 4K and text would look sharp.</p><p>Apple has been working on the headset for seven years and has delayed the launch several times, the Journal previously reported. The headset is far more expensive than headsets sold by rivals, such as Meta Platforms’ most expensive Quest Pro headset at $1,000.</p><p>Although Apple showcased many potential features and uses of the Vision Pro headset, the company’s announcement at its software conference points to its interest in how third-party software makers can add new functions.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of apps that already exist on iPad and iPhone operating systems will also be available through Vision OS, the Vision Pro’s operating system. Apple told developers that it is introducing tools to let them redesign existing apps on other Apple platforms for the Vision Pro, or create new types of three-dimensional apps.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>unveil 为···揭幕，拉开···的帷幔；首次展示，介绍，推出</p><p>headset 头戴式耳机</p><p>overlay 在··上铺；覆盖，包，铺</p><p>blend 混合，混杂，交融</p><p>immersive 沉浸式的，身临其境的，沉浸感的</p><p>spatial 空间的</p><p>augment 提高，增强</p><p>ship 运输，运送；上市，把···推向市场</p><p>dominate 占支配地位的，拥有优势，最明显的</p><p>pretape 预录，提前录好</p><p>simultaneously 同时地</p><p>akin to sth 与某物相似的</p><p>latency 延迟；潜伏</p><p>resolution 决议，决心，决定；清晰度，分辨率</p><p>render 使成为，使变得；给予，提供；粉刷</p></blockquote>]]></content>

His wife of 32 years, Melody Maginnis, even decided to join him for the last 60 days of the challenge.</p><p>Those 100 days came to a close on Thursday. And the final tally? 58½ lbs. total loss — down to 179½.</p><p>“I feel amazing,” Kevin said, while appearing on the Today show to discuss his journey. “</p><p>Today anchors Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Craig Melvin, and Carson Daly were wowed by the results, asking him everything from “what did you eat?” to “is this sustainable?”</p><p>The entire McDonald’s menu was on the table for Kevin. “Pick a number, I’ve eaten everything from Big Macs to quarter pounders — with fries,” he said on Today, joking, “Don’t get bitter while I’m eating my apple fritter and losing weight!”</p><p>He did replace the soda on the menu with water, didn’t drink any alcohol and didn’t eat any fruit and vegetables aside from the lettuce and tomato on burgers, the apples in the apple fritter and the blueberries in the blueberry muffin.</p><p>Snacking between meals was also prohibited, Kevin — living by the saying “seek the heat before you eat, meaning don’t eat any snacks between, so you can actually feel when your body’s actually hungry” — detailed.</p><p>Though he didn’t exercise at all and never counted calories, Kevin saw significant changes to his health. After doing bloodwork, Kevin said his triglycerides were down 205 points and his cholesterol 65 points. His A1C levels also dropped. “Can eating a quarter pounder with cheese improve my A1C? Looks like it can because I was pre-diabetic before, down to healthy ranges now.”</p><p>Kevin will eat his final McDonald’s meal of the challenge this evening. Tomorrow, he said, he’s going to have filet mignon.</p><p>But he isn’t done eating McDonald’s, telling Today that food wasn’t the problem. “You could do this with any food. Stop vilifying the food,” Kevin said. “It’s not that ‘good food, bad food’ for weight loss. Are there better macronutrients and micronutrients for brain health or whatever? Absolutely. But when it comes to getting rid of obesity, reduce the size of the meals. Three meals, cut in half — it’s not the only way, it’s a way. Portion control, have a plan, and have some accountability.”</p><p>He’s confident he’ll be able to sustain his diet, noting he’s going to do “half a plate to lose the weight, three-quarters of a plate to maintain the weight.” He won’t be snacking between meals, either. “Because you seek the heat before you eat, your body’s actually pulling from the fat reserves in between, so you’re not eating, snacking, so you have this energy from burning actual food on your body.”</p><p>As for Kevin’s wife, Melody is down 17 lbs. herself, he said.</p><p>The two were not affiliated with McDonald’s at all, Kevin stressed on Today. He only picked McDonald’s because ‘I was a big guy, my last name’s Maginnis, so ‘Big Mac’ has been a nickname. I thought, ‘If a fat man can embrace fats, I can embrace Big Mac.’ “</p><p>Kevin isn’t done challenging himself. “Round 1 was to eliminate the obesity. Round 2 is increase the beast in me,” he shared. “I’m going to be doing an ice plunge, I’m going to do a 100 ft. rope climb in 100 days. I never made it 10 ft. in gym class, so it’s my personal Everest. I’m going to climb a 100 ft. rope in 100 days.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>lbs 磅（重量单位）</p><p>tally 记录，积分表，帐</p><p>anchor 把···系住（或扎牢），使稳固；使扎根，使基于；主持人</p><p>wow 使印象深刻，使叫绝</p><p>quater pounder 足三两</p><p>bitter 充满仇恨的，愤怒的，激烈的；苦的；严寒的，刺骨的</p><p>fritter 油炸馅饼</p><p>lettuce 生菜，莴苣</p><p>muffin 小松饼</p><p>diabetic 糖尿病患者</p><p>filet mignon 菲力牛排</p><p>vilify 诋毁，污蔑，丑化，贬低</p><p>macronutrient 大量营养素</p><p>accountability 责任感，有责任，有义务</p><p>plate 盘子，碟子，镀上</p><p>affiliate 隶属的，附属的</p><p>eliminate 消除，根除；淘汰</p><p>beast 野兽，动物</p></blockquote>]]></content>

And how do those guys selling tickets on the street outside the venue get their inventory?</p><p>Scalpers (“ticket touters” to the British and “leveraged arbitragers” to ardent capitalists) are as old as live events themselves. When the Greeks opened the first-ever outdoor amphitheatre in 325 BCE — it was built into the hillside of the Acropolis and sat up to 17,000 people in its 55 semi-circular rows — there was no doubt some dude in a robe outside the gates yelling “Who’s got seats?” The same would have happened at the first Roman theatre in Pompeii in 80 BCE. And I’d lay money on the same thing happening outside of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre for the premiere of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1604.</p><p>Scalping (a term that first appeared in the 19th century referring to brokers of railway tickets) has always been a problem. How could a regular person get into shows when there were crowds of “ticket speculators” and “sidewalk men” who employed people to stand in line for them and had secret access to insiders at the box office who gladly handed over tickets for a cut of the proceeds?</p><p>When Jenny Lind, a singer known as “The Swedish Nightingale,” toured the United States in 1851, the very best seats in the house mysteriously disappeared immediately only to reappear in the hands of speculators who sold them with significant markups. A ticket with a face value of $3 might go for $6. There was a rumour that Lind’s agents were in on the scam, something that damaged her in the eyes of the public.</p><p>When Charles Dickens went on a book tour of America in 1867, his public readings sold out in minutes. George Dolby, Dickens’ manager, lamented about a show in Boston. “[B]y eight o’clock in the morning, the queue [outside the box office] was nearly half a mile long and about the time that the employers of the persons who had been standing in the streets all night began to arrive to take their places. … The horrid speculators who buy all the good tickets and sell them again at exorbitant prices.” In New York, fans waiting in line were offered as much as twenty dollars for their place in line by scalpers looking to acquire tickets.</p><p>Time and time again, theatres, performers, managers, agents, promoters, and governments have tried to clamp down on scalping. In 1927, New York City looked into the situation with Broadway theatres and local music halls. Nothing happened. The same with an investigation in 1949. And again in 1963. Nothing, it seemed, could be done about a black market in theatre tickets that totalled millions of dollars each year. It wasn’t uncommon for a box office manager to earn beyond $25,000 a year and buy a new Cadillac every year. Guess where that supplementary income came from?</p><p>The problem only became bigger when rock concerts became big business. In the days before computers, box offices had racks of printed tickets, the best of which vanished before sales even began.</p><p>Maintaining an accurate ticket count (and thus a proper accounting of revenue) was impossible using the system of hard tickets sold through a box office. Surely there had to be a solution. This is where the first computerized ticket-selling programs came into existence. The first, Computicket and TRS (Ticket Reservation Services), arrived in the middle 1960s, prompting their systems as a way to cut down on scalping by keeping track of every single ticket sold.</p><p>Great in theory, but despite decades of advancements with computerized ticket selling, paperless tickets, and fan-driven ticket exchanges, scalpers and secondary-market companies still manage to get their hands on tickets.</p><p>The problem is not going away. In fact, things are just getting weirder and more contentious. “Diggers” and “ice” also still exist in the digital realm. Instead of bribing box office managers and hiring people to stand in line, they use bots, fake identities, access comp tickets, and infiltrate sales meant for fan clubs. They’re pretty resourceful and tech-savvy people.</p><p>This past Friday, Jan. 20, Madonna started selling tickets for her worldwide 40th-anniversary Celebration Tour, Ticketmaster’s first major on-sale challenge since the Taylor Swift fiasco late last year. Although tickets were advertised for as little as $40, you have to wonder how many of those made it into the hands of fans at that price and how many are now controlled by the secondary market (StubHub, SeatGeek, Vivid Tickets, etc.) as well as individual scalpers.</p><p>Also this week, a new campaign called Make Tickets Fair launched in the U.K. and EU. The goal is to educate the public about the perils and protocols of ticket reselling. It may help a little bit, but I can’t help feeling that organizers are wasting their breath.</p><p>It all comes down to this: When you have a perishable high-demand commodity like a concert ticket, someone is always going to find a way to make money from someone else’s desires. It’s a game of Whack-A-Mole as old as live entertainment itself.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>scalp 头皮；手下败将，击败的人；倒卖</p><p>inflated 过高的，过多的</p><p>inventory 存货；物品清单；盘点，清点存货</p><p>scalper 倒卖的人</p><p>tout 标榜，吹嘘，吹捧；，高价出售，（以高价格）倒卖</p><p>leveraged 举债经营的；依赖借款的，举债的，高杠杆的</p><p>arbitrageur 套购商，证券套利者</p><p>ardent 热烈的，热情的，强烈的</p><p><em>amphitheatre</em> 圆形剧场</p><p>robe 长袍</p><p>lay 打赌，下注</p><p>premiere 首映，首演；首相，总理</p><p>broker 经纪人</p><p>speculator 投机者，投机商</p><p>sidewalk men 票贩子</p><p>cut 伤口，切口；份额</p><p>proceeds 收入，收益</p><p>nightingale 夜莺</p><p>markup 加价幅度</p><p>lament 对···感到悲痛</p><p>horrid 不友好的，令人不愉快的</p><p>exorbitant 费用过高的</p><p>clamp down on 取缔，严厉打击</p><p>supplementary 额外</p><p>big business 利润高的行业</p><p>accounting 会计，会计学，核算</p><p>contentious 有争议的</p><p>ice 回扣，分成</p><p>realm 领域，场所；王国</p><p>comp 馈赠，赠送</p><p>infiltrate 潜入，渗透</p><p>resourceful 足智多谋的</p><p>savvy 常识，实际能力；有见识的</p><p>fiasco 惨败，可耻的失败，尴尬的结局</p><p>peril 巨大的危险，险情</p><p>waste your breath 白费唇舌</p><p>perishable 易腐烂的，易变质的</p></blockquote>]]></content>

He would be 82 at the start of a second term if he wins.</p><p>This fall, in addition to previous stumbles from his bicycle and on the way up the Air Force One stairs, could add to those concerns.</p><p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner to face Mr Biden in the 2024 White House election, reacted to the incident from a campaign event in Iowa, saying “the whole thing is crazy”.</p><p>“I hope he wasn’t hurt,” said Mr Trump, 76, who has often poked fun at Mr Biden’s age. “That’s not inspiring.”</p><p>“You got to be careful about that because you don’t - you don’t want that. Even if you have to tiptoe down the ramp,” added Mr Trump, apparently referring to his own careful walk off a stage that made headlines in 2020.</p><p>He said at the time that the ramp at the US Military Academy in West Point, New York, was slippery, and brushed aside the ensuing media questions about his own health as fake news.</p><p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another 2024 contender for the Republican nomination, also reacted to the fall during a campaign event in New Hampshire: “We hope and wish Joe Biden a swift recovery from any injuries he may have sustained.</p><p>“But we also wish the United States of America a swift recovery from the injuries it has sustained because of Joe Biden and his policies.”</p><p>Mr Biden’s last physical examination took place in February.</p><p>White House physician Dr Kevin O’Connor wrote at the time: “The President remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.”</p><p>Dr O’Connor added that Mr Biden walks with a “stiffened gait”, largely caused by wear and tear on his spine and nerve damage in his feet, but that his condition was unchanged from a previous physical in November 2021.</p><p>Mr Biden is hardly the first commander-in-chief to lose his footing in front of the cameras.</p><p>President Barack Obama tripped walking up stairs at a 2012 event, while President Gerald Ford fell down the stairs of Air Force One in 1975.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>trip</em> 绊倒</p><p><em>diploma</em> 学位证书，大学文凭</p><p><em>serving</em> 一份；现任的，现役的</p><p><em>cadet</em> 军校学员，警校学员</p><p><em>sandbag</em> 沙袋</p><p><em>press pool</em> 记者团</p><p><em>footage</em> 镜头片段</p><p><em>prop sth up</em> 支撑，撑住</p><p><em>teleprompter</em> 提词器</p><p><em>detail</em> 熟词僻义，此处为特遣队的意思</p><p><em>jog</em> 慢跑；蹒跚前行</p><p><em>motorcade</em> 车队</p><p><em>board</em> 董事会，委员会；上船&#x2F;飞机&#x2F;火车</p><p><em>flash</em> 使闪耀，使闪光；出示，显示</p><p><em>stumble</em> 犯错，失足；踉跄，绊脚</p><p><em>frontrunner</em> 领先者</p><p><em>poke fun at sb</em> 取笑某人，打趣，奚落某人</p><p><em>tiptoe</em> 踮着脚走</p><p><em>ramp</em> 斜坡，坡道</p><p><em>brush sb&#x2F;sth aside</em> 对···置之不理，漠视</p><p><em>ensuing</em> 随后发生的</p><p><em>contender</em> 竞争者，争夺者</p><p><em>swift</em> 迅速的，敏捷的，快的</p><p><em>sustain</em> 保持，维持；经历，遭受</p><p><em>exemption</em> 豁免</p><p>accommodation 住处，工作场所，停留处</p><p><em>stiffen</em> 变僵硬，变得不易弯曲</p><p><em>gait</em> 步态，步履</p><p><em>wear and tear</em> 磨损，损耗</p><p><em>spine</em> 脊柱，脊椎</p><p><em>commander-in-chief</em> 总司令，总指挥</p></blockquote>]]></content>

And often times, you can’t tell which. Either way, run.”</p><p>NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang today urged graduates of National Taiwan University to run hard to seize the unprecedented opportunities that AI will present, but embrace the inevitable failures along the way.</p><p>Whatever you pursue, he told the 10,000 graduates of the premier university, do it with passion and conviction — and stay humble enough to learn the hard lessons that await.</p><p>“Whatever it is, run after it like we did. Run. Don’t walk,” Huang said, having swapped his signature black leather jacket for a black graduation robe, with the school’s plum-blossom emblem highlighting a royal blue, white and aqua collar.</p><p>“Remember, either you are running for food; or you are running from becoming food. And often times, you can’t tell which. Either way, run.”</p><p>Huang, who moved from Taiwan when he was young, recognized his parents in the audience, and shared three stories of initial failures and retreat. He called them instrumental in helping forge NVIDIA’s character during its three-decade journey from a three-person gaming-graphics startup to a global AI leader worth nearly a trillion dollars.</p><p>“I was … successful — until I started NVIDIA,” he said. “At NVIDIA, I experienced failures — great big ones. All humiliating and embarrassing. Many nearly doomed us.”</p><p>The first involved a key early contract the company won to help Sega build a gaming console. Rapid changes in the industry forced NVIDIA to give up the contract in a near-death brush with bankruptcy, which Sega’s leadership helped avert.</p><p>“Confronting our mistake and, with humility, asking for help saved NVIDIA,” he said.</p><p>The second was the decision in 2007 to put CUDA into all the company’s GPUs, enabling them to crunch data in addition to handling 3D graphics. It was an expensive, long-term investment that drew much criticism didn’t pay off for years until the chips started being used for machine learning.</p><p>“Our market cap hovered just above a billion dollars,” he recalled. “We suffered many years of poor performance. Our shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we improve profitability.”</p><p>The third was the decision in 2010 to charge into the promising mobile-phone market as graphics-rich capabilities were coming into reach. The market quickly commoditized, though, and NVIDIA retreated just as quickly, taking initial heat but opening the door to investing in promising new markets — robotics and self-driving cars.</p><p>“Our strategic retreat paid off,” he said. “By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.”</p><p>Huang told grads that of the parallels in terms of boundless promise between the world he entered upon graduating four decades ago, on the cusp of the PC revolution, and the brave new age of AI they are entering today.</p><p>“For your journey, take along some of my learnings,” he said. Admit mistakes and ask for help; endure pain and suffering to realize your dreams; and make sacrifices to dedicate yourself to a life of purpose.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>unprecedented</em> 史无前例的，空前的，绝无仅有的</p><p><em>inevitable</em> 不可避免的，必然发生的</p><p><em>premier</em> 首相，总理</p><p><em>conviction</em> 信念；判罪，定罪</p><p><em>signature</em> 签名，署名；明显特征，鲜明特色，识别标志</p><p><em>robe</em> 长袍，罩袍</p><p><em>plum-blossom</em> 梅花</p><p><em>emblem</em> 象征，标志，符号，徽章</p><p><em>aqua</em> 浅绿色的</p><p><em>collar</em> 衣领</p><p><em>retreat</em> 改变，退缩，放弃；撤退，退却，后退</p><p><em>instrumental</em> 起作用的，有帮助的</p><p><em>forge</em> 创造，缔造，艰苦干成，努力加强；伪造；制造，生产</p><p><em>startup</em> 刚起步的小企业，新兴小型企业</p><p><em>humiliating</em> 令人感到耻辱的，丢脸的</p><p><em>doom</em> 死亡，厄运，毁灭，劫数；使注定，使必然发生</p><p><em>a brush with sth</em> 和…的小冲突，与…的摩擦</p><p><em>avert</em> 防止，避免；转移，把···转向某处</p><p><em>humility</em> 谦逊，谦恭</p><p><em>crunch</em> 不足，短缺，缺钱；严峻的形势，紧要关头；嘎吱作响；处理信息</p><p><em>market cap</em> 市值</p><p><em>hover</em> 徘徊，盘旋</p><p><em>commoditize</em> 商业化</p><p><em>boundless</em> 无限的</p><p><em>on the cusp</em> 介于两个状态之间</p></blockquote>]]></content>

What was meant as joking around with the boys, when you are the subject of the comments amount to sexual harassment.</p><p>She told the human resources team who handled her exit interview that this kind of office “humour” had driven her to attempt suicide.</p><p>‘Disparaging’</p><p>While Kate’s experience was extreme, others agree with her, that “jokes” at work often get out of hand. In one survey, out of 20,000 people questioned, only 16% of British women were comfortable with sexual workplace humour.</p><p>On the other hand, 28% of men in the UK think it is okay to tell a dirty joke at work. And British men are happier to have a laugh over a crude joke, than men from many other parts of the world including Turkey, Mexico, Australia, Canada and the United States.</p><p>The difference between having a joke in the workplace or delaying it until “you are with your mates at the pub” can mean a lot to female co-workers, says Hillary Margolis a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p><p>“A lot of women feel they have to brush or laugh off a joke or they will be seen as too serious. But it can make women and those who identify as non-binary - and also people who are LGTBQ - feel disparaged,” she says.</p><p>Sexist jokes can also make men feel uncomfortable, especially if they are in a female dominated work environment.</p><p>‘Impact understated’</p><p>More often than not, a joke is really meant to be a joke, Ms Margolis says, but sometimes people think sexual humour at work is a form of sexism, which makes women feel excluded.</p><p>“Sometimes these things can shut people down and make women feel like they have to hide who they truly are.</p><p>“Women will often laugh at these kind of jokes in the workplace because they don’t want to be perceived as being too emotional, sensitive or like they just can’t hack it,” says Ms Margolis.</p><p>Having to feel like they not free to be themselves, can put people on the back foot.</p><p>She adds: “Sometimes the impact is really underestimated”.</p><p>Not tolerated</p><p>Kate’s upsetting experience was some years ago now. Bev Shah, who founded City Hive, a social network for workers in finance, says she does not know of anyone these days who would joke openly this way.</p><p>“These types of jokes are no longer acceptable in any public forum in the same way racial jokes no longer are,” said Ms Shah.</p><p>She says any comments of that sort should ring immediate alarm bells for employers, especially in the post #metoo era, and shouldn’t be tolerated.</p><p>Speaking up</p><p>The survey, by Ipsos MORI and the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership at King’s College London asked people across the world in 27 countries.</p><p>The countries where workplace humour of a sexual nature was most acceptable were Belgium and China where 47% of men would joke or tell stories about sex.</p><p>Where as under 13% of men in Mexico, America and Canada agreed.</p><p>When it comes to speaking up, just like Kate will today, British women do not fear pushing back against inappropriate jokes. Over 80% of UK women surveyed said they would “tell off family or friends who make a sexist comment”.</p><p>And, British men also said they would stick up for women as well with 73% willing to take a stand against sexism.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>roll with the punches</em> 逆来顺受</p><p><em>unrelenting</em> 坚定不移的，不松懈的；无休止的，不缓和的</p><p><em>innuendo</em> 影射的话，暗讽的话</p><p><em>knickers</em> 女用内裤</p><p><em>plug in</em> 给···接通电源，把某一电器与另一电器接通</p><p><em>banter</em> 无恶意的玩笑</p><p><em>blurred</em> 模糊的；分不清的</p><p><em>amount to sth</em> 等于，意味着，达到，总计</p><p><em>sexual harassment</em> 性骚扰</p><p><em>disparaging</em> 贬低的，贬斥的</p><p><em>pub</em> 酒吧</p><p><em>brush sth off</em> 漠视，不理睬</p><p><em>laugh sth off</em> 对···一笑置之</p><p><em>non-binary</em> 非二元性别的</p><p><em>more often than not</em> 往往，多半；通常，常常，一般</p><p><em>exclude</em> 排除···，不考虑···，认为··不可能；阻止，排斥</p><p><em>perceive</em> 意识到，察觉，感知，注意到；认为，看待，视为</p><p><em>can’t hack it</em> 不能应付（某情形）</p><p><em>put sb on the back foot</em> 使人处于劣势或被动的位置</p><p><em>ring alarm bells</em> 敲警钟，发出危险信号，引起警觉</p><p><em>tell off</em> 斥责，责备</p><p><em>stick up for sth&#x2F;sb</em> 支持，维护（想法，遭受指责或攻击的人）</p><p><em>sexism</em> 性别歧视</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p>玩笑归玩笑，但不应把低俗和恶趣味等东西也当成玩笑然后试图来蒙混过关。</p><p>向性骚扰大胆say no，绝对支持！</p>]]></content>

S. relations to driving a Tesla vehicle, which requires holding the steering wheel correctly, stepping on the brakes at the right time, avoiding dangerous driving and using the gas pedal appropriately, according to a readout from the ministry. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Grace Tao, a Tesla executive who heads up external affairs for its China operations, reposted the foreign ministry’s statement on her social-media account on China’s Weibo platform.</p><p>Musk joins a list of foreign CEOs, including Apple’s Tim Cook and Pfizer’s Albert Bourla, who in recent months have paid visits to China to meet senior officials and visit local facilities. </p><p>Last year, Musk hosted Qin at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., while Qin was the Chinese ambassador to the U.S.</p><p>Decoupling has become a buzzword among foreign executives and policy experts, used to refer to the unwinding of deep economic and commercial ties between the U.S. and China that have been built up over the years. U.S. officials have said the U.S. isn’t seeking to decouple from China, but safeguard its technological interests. </p><p>Tesla has doubled down on China, announcing in April that it plans to build a second factory in Shanghai to produce its Megapack energy storage product. </p><p>In the past, Musk has lavished praise on China, calling its economic prosperity truly amazing and hailing its data laws. Some of Musk’s ties to China have prompted unease in Washington.</p><p>Musk is expected to visit Tesla’s Shanghai factory later this week, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Tesla enjoyed a period of booming car sales in the world’s biggest automobile market after setting up its gigafactory in Shanghai in 2019 as the first wholly owned foreign carmaker in China. The company now faces intense competition from local rivals, who can offer a range of comparable electric vehicles at lower prices as the Chinese car industry market grows more mature.</p><p>Tesla’s market share in China has fallen by almost a third, to 10% last year from around 15% in 2020, according to data from China Passenger Car Association. </p><p>More than half of the car maker’s electric cars delivered globally last year were made in China and the Chinese market contributed to about 22% of its revenue, with almost 440,000 EVs sold in the country, according to Chinese industry data and company filings. </p><p>Tesla’s presence in China also helped fuel China’s EV industry, with eight in 10 cars sold in the country made by homegrown brands last year. Chinese EV maker BYD has surpassed Tesla in sales both in China and globally.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>decouple</em> 使分开，使脱离</p><p><em>quote</em> 引用，引述，援引</p><p><em>intertwine</em> 缠结，缠绕在一起，紧密关联</p><p><em>inseparable</em> （事物）分不开的，不可分的</p><p><em>conjoined</em> 结合的，联合的，连接在一起的</p><p><em>plant</em> 植物；工厂</p><p><em>onset</em> 开端，发生</p><p><em>linken sb&#x2F;sth to sb&#x2F;sth</em> 认为…与…相像</p><p><em>steering wheel</em> 方向盘</p><p><em>brake</em> 刹车，制动器，车闸</p><p><em>gas pedal</em> 油门踏板</p><p><em>readout</em> 输出，读出，显示，打印</p><p><em>repost</em> 转发</p><p><em>ambassador</em> 大使</p><p><em>buzzword</em> 流行语，热词，流行术语</p><p><em>unwind</em> 解开，打开，松开；放松，轻松</p><p><em>lavish sth on sb&#x2F;sth</em> 为…倾注，为…挥霍</p><p><em>prosperity</em> 成功，繁荣，昌盛</p><p><em>hail</em> 把···称赞为，把···誉为</p><p><em>prompt</em> 提词，提白；促使，导致，激起</p><p><em>booming</em> 繁荣的，迅速发展的</p><p><em>comparable</em> 类似的，相当的，可比的</p><p><em>EV</em> Electric Vehicle 简写，电动汽车</p><p><em>fuel</em> 燃料；加剧，增加，刺激</p><p><em>surpass</em> 优于，超过</p></blockquote>]]></content>

He later told the broadcaster KBS that he thought “damaging a work of modern art could also be [interpreted as] artwork” and that he came up with the idea to reattach the peel as “a joke”.</p><p>He added: “I thought it would be interesting … isn’t it taped there to be eaten?”</p><p>The banana, part of Cattelan’s Comedian installation, gets replaced every two or three days.</p><p>Cattelan, a sculptor and performance artist based in New York, was reportedly informed about the incident and simply replied: “No problem.”</p><p>It is not the first time a banana from the work has been scoffed. During the work’s debut exhibit at Miami Art Basel in 2019 a banana was removed and eaten by the performance artist David Datuna.</p><p>Datuna later told the Guardian that while he considered Cattelan to be “a genius”, he took issue with the huge amount of money made from a banana that cost 20 cents.</p><p>The first and second editions on display at Miami Art Basel both sold for $120,000 (£95,640), and another was put up for sale for $150,000 before Datuna showed up to eat the fruit. “I have travelled in 67 countries around the world in the last three years, and I see how people live,” Datuna said. “Millions are dying without food. Then he puts three bananas on the wall for half a million dollars?”</p><p>Cattelan, who was born in Padua, is also known for provocative artworks that challenge popular culture. One – an 18-carat gold toilet called America and valued at £1m – made headlines in September 2019 after it was ripped from its display wall during an overnight robbery at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.</p><p>A middle-finger sculpture by Cattelan – known as Il Dito (the finger) but officially called L.O.V.E – opposite the stock exchange in Milan was vandalised by environmental activists in January.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>renowned</em> 有名的，闻名的，受尊敬的</p><p><em>installation</em> 装置艺术</p><p><em>brazenly</em> 毫不隐瞒地，明目张胆地</p><p><em>duck tape</em> 强力胶带</p><p><em>peel</em> 剥去；（水果或蔬菜的）外皮</p><p><em>stunned</em> 目瞪口呆</p><p><em>attach</em> 附上，固定，连接</p><p><em>grin</em> 咧嘴笑</p><p><em>herald</em> 预告，宣传；预示…来临；预兆</p><p><em>broadcaster</em> 广播员，节目主持人；电视台，广播公司</p><p><em>interpret</em> 诠释，说明；理解为，领会；演绎；翻译，口译</p><p><em>sculptor</em> 雕塑家</p><p><em>scoff</em> 嘲笑，讥笑；狼吞虎咽地吃</p><p><em>debut</em> 首次登台，首次亮相</p><p><em>take issue with sth</em> 对···持强烈不满，很不赞同</p><p><em>provocative</em> 挑衅的，使人生气的，煽动的；引发思考的，启发性的</p><p><em>carat</em> 克拉（钻石的重量单位），开（黄金的纯度单位）</p><p><em>rip</em> 撕裂，撕破，划破；迅速扯开，猛力去除</p><p><em>robbery</em> 抢劫，抢劫罪</p><p><em>sculpture</em> 雕塑，雕像</p><p><em>vandalise</em> 故意破坏，肆意破坏（尤指公共财物）</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p>我不懂艺术，不过我觉得很多所谓的艺术价值其实都是人为炒作出来的，至于它是否有无价值，价值多少，完全取决于人的看法。</p><p>例如，当某件艺术品附上某些专家或名人的名气时，它很有可能就被视作价值连城的一件珍品了。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2023年都过去了一个季度了，现在才开始想着回顾一下2022年的生活，不过好饭不怕晚，借此记录一下，哈哈😬。 </p><h2 id="回顾过去"><a href="#回顾过去" class="headerlink" title="回顾过去"></a>回顾过去</h2><p>2022年应该算得上是我最“颠簸流离”的一年了。</p><h3 id="当老师"><a href="#当老师" class="headerlink" title="当老师"></a>当老师</h3><p>四月份选择从公司离职，本想回来休养生息一下后继续搬砖的，但经朋友介绍进入了某间私立学校当老师。不过由于我专业不对口，也没有教师资格证，因此提出的条件是给实习机会然后让我跟岗学习，同时给予时间考取教资，我没考虑太多也就答应了，由此又踏入了另一个坑 😣。毕竟一切都是从零开始，两个月的时间，我自问算得上勤勤恳恳，认真跟随那些老教师听课学习，学着如何把某个知识通俗易懂地教会学生，学着如何成为一个好老师，积极完成每一项工作…无奈这里面水深的很，一帮老顽固当领导，官僚主义严重，整天只会说理论，假大空，毫无实际。但最令我感到恶心的是最后考核阶段，我完成试讲后，那些领导开始绕圈子，不说可以转正的事，去找他就说在讨论，有消息通知我，明摆着就是拖，到最后让我干完活后就说不合适，让我走就可以了。（此处省略脏话无数，不适合就早点说啊，问来问去就是拖，真的是恶心操作）后来我知道了，原来他们找到了一个师范应届生，可以更好的压榨。不过，我静下心来问了问我自己：这两个月你做的开心吗？答案是否的，我甚至觉得这两个月真是过的煎熬，每天度日如年，又无人可以倾诉，因此离开后我反而释然了，不用再陪着笑脸面对这一帮老顽固了。（不过那些退休老教师虽然看起来有点高傲，但还是很好相处的，跟他们也学到了不少东西，而且因为经常在讲台上面对几十个学生讲课，自己的胆量也有所提高，也没那么社恐了，哈哈，所以这也不失为一种意外收获吧）<br><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2023/04/15/2737162e2b6040f0.jpeg" alt="学校篮球场" style="zoom: 25%;" /></p><h3 id="去考研"><a href="#去考研" class="headerlink" title="去考研"></a>去考研</h3><p>被“炒鱿鱼”后，想着继续投简历回归老本行，没想到疫情肆虐，传染性加强，工作难找，真是屋漏偏逢连夜雨。此时一个从未有过的念头在脑海中浮现——考研，和父母交谈了一番后，他们让我自己做选择，说干就干。此时6月已经接近尾声，我抓住这最后的机会查阅了相关的信息，结合自己的实力以及喜欢的专业，快速地选择了报考院校和专业，然后在7月正式开始了我的考研备考之路。每一科的考试内容基本都是从零开始，尤其数学，算得上是我薄弱项，它从不会欺骗你，因为不会就是不会😂。6个月后，疫情放开恰遇上考研大军，一大波考生考前中招，霎时间人心惶惶，毕竟谁也不想辛苦一年的成果付之东流。幸运的是我没有感染(也可能是无症状)，顺利完成考试…直到2023年4月顺利完成复试，也顺利收到了拟录取通知。<del>一切就像梦一样，醒来很久还是很感动</del>。至此，我的2022低开高走，同时也以此作为一个比较完美的收场。🥳</p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2023/04/16/b60c299cf8dd58c6.jpg" alt="拟录取通知" style="zoom:50%;" /><h2 id="展望未来"><a href="#展望未来" class="headerlink" title="展望未来"></a>展望未来</h2><p>当然是努力学习，天天向上啦，哈哈。希望研究生生涯也完美点吧。</p>]]></content>

Gossip. Fake news.</p><p>We’ve all heard these terms. While most consider them harmless, they can affect your health. Learning to tell the difference between fact and fiction can be a real boost – both mentally and physically.</p><p>What happens when rumors aren’t harmless? What if they damage someone’s reputation, livelihood, or personal life?</p><p>If you’re on the receiving end of untrue gossip, what do you do?</p><p>Rumors vs. Gossip vs. ‘Fake News’</p><p>Rumors are defined as widely spread talk with no reliable source to back it up. They aren’t always bad. Some rumors can even seem positive, like promotions, engagements, or awards.</p><p>But until proven otherwise, they are just that – rumors.</p><p>Gossip is when you take rumors – those unconfirmed pieces of information – and pass them along, spreading what may be “fake news.”</p><p>What may be surprising is how difficult it can be to tell rumor and gossip from truth. Even people who are Internet-savvy can have trouble telling what’s real and what’s not. It can also be tough to tell the difference between news and advertisement. As a result, people sometimes give more weight to what they see in their social media feed than what they get from more credible news sources.</p><p>What’s the Harm?</p><p>When it comes to “fake news,” the effects can be both immediate and long-lasting. In most cases, a “fake news” story can rile up your emotions and change your mood. Depending on the strength of your feelings, the story, and the reaction it gave you, can stick in your head, even after you find out it’s false. You may even remember those feelings if you see another story about the same subject.</p><p>On their own, rumors and gossip seem harmless; almost a fun pastime. But there’s a point where they can become harmful to your health.</p><p>There’s a great deal of information out there about bullying among teenagers and younger children. What’s sometimes overlooked is that adults can be bullied, too.</p><p>It can come in the form of untrue rumors or gossip about them or a loved one. It can also come through reactions to words or an image that’s been posted.</p><p>Physical appearance, politics, and financial issues can all become the subject of online bullying, too.</p><p>It’s far from something to brush off. It can bring things like:</p><p>· Exhaustion</p><p>· Anxiety</p><p>· Depression</p><p>What’s more, all this talk can escalate to physical violence. When it’s not addressed, it can also cause long-term physical and mental health issues, including:</p><p>· Clinical depression</p><p>· Posttraumatic stress disorder</p><p>· Panic attacks</p><p>· Guilt</p><p>· Suicide</p><p>What Can You Do?</p><p>Rumors, gossip, and fake news can make you feel helpless, angry, and very anxious. There are steps you can take to regain your power and your health.</p><p>To avoid fake news, you can:</p><p>· Watch out for sites that end in “.com.co.” Often, these are bootleg versions of traditional news services.</p><p>· Try to find other articles on the same topic from other sites, especially if the first article you read makes you upset. It’s possible that the anger-inducing story was created in a way to rile you up.</p><p>· Check another source if an article you read uses all caps, either in headlines or in the article itself.</p><p>· Click the “About Us” tab for more information about the source.</p><p>· Poke around a little to see if other, more-known sites are reporting the story. If it’s legitimate, at least one other site would cover it.</p><p>· Be careful about blogs, even if they’re tied to well-known sites. In many cases, blogs aren’t held to the same editorial standard as regular news pieces.</p><p>When you come across a piece of gossip, a juicy rumor, or an unflattering photo that clearly is aimed at hurting the subject, don’t share it, don’t comment, and don’t engage. You might be able to help someone who doesn’t know how to combat the problem by simply reporting it for them.</p><p>If you’re the subject of a rumor, gossip, or bullying, it’s important to remember that not every bit of teasing is bullying. But when it escalates to that point, don’t respond. Cut them off – block the calls and texts, and block them on social media.</p><p>Get in touch with your Internet service provider if the abuse is coming through a website or your smartphone. Chances are the bully is violating their terms of service. If so, the offensive posts will disappear. You can also contact the police. There are laws against harassment, stalking, and threatening behavior.</p><p>Don’t engage with them. Don’t forward the messages to friends. Most of all, don’t believe whatever is being said about you.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>rumor</em> 谣言，传闻</p><p><em>gossip</em> 流言蜚语</p><p><em>term</em> 术语，长期，期限，名词</p><p><em>boost</em> 提升，改善，提高</p><p><em>livelihood</em> 生计</p><p><em>promotion</em> 晋升</p><p><em>engagement</em> 订婚</p><p><em>award</em> 奖励，奖品，获奖</p><p><em>prove</em> 证实</p><p><em>otherwise</em> 否则</p><p><em>savvy</em> 有见识的，通情达理的</p><p><em>feed</em> 供给，喂养，信息流</p><p><em>rile</em> 激怒</p><p><em>a great deal of</em> 大量的</p><p><em>bully</em> 欺负，欺凌</p><p><em>subject</em> 科目，主体，对象</p><p><em>brush sth off</em> 漠视，不理睬</p><p><em>escalate</em> 加剧</p><p><em>address</em> 地址，解决</p><p><em>Clinical depression</em> 临床抑郁症</p><p><em>Posttraumatic stress disorder</em> 创伤后应激障碍</p><p><em>Panic attacks</em> 惊恐发作</p><p><em>bootleg</em> 盗版的</p><p><em>caps</em> 大写字母</p><p><em>poke</em> 搜索，翻找</p><p><em>legitimate</em> 合法的</p><p><em>juicy</em> 多汁的，信息生动有趣的，富于刺激性的，重要的，高质量的</p><p><em>unflattering</em> 不恭维的，有损形象的</p><p><em>harassment</em> 骚扰，侵扰</p><p><em>stalk</em> （非法）跟踪，盯梢</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>针对日前苏州大学某大学生造黄谣问题，指出谣言的危害以及给出面对谣言时相对应的一些解决方法。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>不信谣不传谣，对网络上的各种传言保持清醒，不要丢失自己的判断能力，不要人云亦云，让子弹飞一会。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

No one had called 911 to report a man in trouble. No one even knew anyone had witnessed the drowning until the video emerged on social media, and Dunn’s family members saw it.</p><p>Its contents have shocked the community in the city of Cocoa, on Florida’s east coast. But the teens, aged between 14 and 16, will face no charges, prosecutors have said: there is nothing on the statute books which deal with an incident like this, they say.</p><p>The vast majority of states in America do not put a “duty to rescue” on their citizens, but 10 do.</p><p>But even these do not cover all instances. Florida is one of the few states to have such a law, but it only covers reporting a sexual battery if witnessed or suspected, according to The Volokh Conspiracy, a blog written mainly by law professors.</p><p>In fact, only a few countries in the world have a law which means people have to help or risk prison time, including Germany, where four people are currently being prosecuted for “unterlassene Hilfeleistung” (failure to provide assistance).</p><p>According to local reports in Germany, last October an 82-year-old man collapsed in a bank in Essen, but was then ignored by other customers, ranging in age from 39 to 62, for the next 20 minutes.</p><p>A fifth customer eventually called an ambulance, but it was too late, and the man died a few days later in hospital.</p><p>Paparazzi</p><p>Perhaps the most high-profile instance of a law like this involved the death of Princess Diana.</p><p>Seven photographers were accused of failing to render assistance by French investigators following the 1997 Paris crash which killed the princess, her boyfriend Dodi Al-Fayed and driver Henri Paul.</p><p>The men had taken photographs rather than helping the dying occupants of the car, it was alleged.</p><p>But after two years of investigation, all charges were dropped against them.</p><p>Fear</p><p>But why would you have such rules?</p><p>Sometimes, however, people are more worried about being landed with a bill - or getting into legal trouble.</p><p>~</p><p>But many social media users understood the decision, according to the New York Times.</p><p>“If I helped her to get up and sent her to the hospital, doctors would ask you to pay the medical bill,” one wrote. “Her relatives would come and beat you up indiscriminately.”</p><p>Protection</p><p>The teenagers in the Florida case, however, would not have ended up in trouble. Every state in the US has a “good Samaritan law”, which largely protects those who try to help in an emergency situation from being sued.</p><p>But whether or not this factored into their thinking is unknown. The teens were heard to mention alligators - but that would not have prevented them calling 911.</p><p>As for the moral argument, Yvonne Martinez, the Cocoa Police Department spokeswoman, told Florida Today at least one of the boys did not seem worried by the implications of what they had done.</p><p>“There was no remorse, only a smirk,” she said.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>harrowing</em> 折磨人的，令人肠断的，使人十分难过的，恐怖的</p><p><em>mock</em> 嘲笑；假的，假装的</p><p><em>drown</em> 淹死，溺死</p><p><em>prosecutor</em> 公诉人，检察官；原告律师，控方律师</p><p><em>statute book</em> 法典，法令全书</p><p><em>battery</em> 电池；殴打，暴力行为</p><p><em>conspiracy</em> 合谋，阴谋，密谋策划</p><p><em>collapse</em> 崩溃，垮掉，失败；倒下，昏倒</p><p><em>paparazzi</em> 狗仔队</p><p><em>profile</em> 简介；关注度</p><p><em>princess</em> 王妃，公主</p><p><em>render</em> 表达，表现；使成为；给予，提供</p><p><em>occupant</em> 占有人，占用者</p><p><em>land sb with sth</em> 给某人惹下麻烦，给某人出难题</p><p><em>indiscriminately</em> 不加选择地，不分青红皂白地</p><p><em>alligator</em> 短吻鳄</p><p><em>implication</em> 可能的影响（或作用、结果）；含义，暗示</p><p><em>remorse</em> 悔恨，自责</p><p><em>smirk</em> 傻笑，假笑，得意地笑</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p>个人认为想要救人优先要想如何自保，只有保护好自己的前提下才有资本谈救人。</p><p>若单凭自己的能力无法帮助到他人的时候，也应当寻求合适的帮助。</p><p>PS：文中的那5个青少年见死不救的行为真是令人感到可怕，更令人感到悲伤的是只能从道德上谴责他们而无法从法律上惩罚他们…</p>]]></content>

1.2之后才被引入，但是类加载器的概念和抽象类java.lang.ClassLoader则在Java的第一个版本中就已经存在，因此为了兼容已有代码，做了一些妥协：即引导大家尽可能地重写java.lang.ClassLoader中的<code>findClass()</code>方法，而不要重写loadClass()方法</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/28/e2c1782c155a908b.png" alt="image-20220126154642582"></p></li><li><p>第二次破坏：</p><blockquote><p>由于模型自身缺陷导致，基础类基本都能够被上层加载器加载，但当基础类想要调用用户代码的时候，就会存在问题。因此引入了<code>线程上下文类加载器</code>（这个类加载器可以通过java.lang.Thread类的setContext-ClassLoader()方法进行设置，如果创建线程时还未设置，它将会从父线程中继承一个，如果在应用程序的全局范围内都没有设置过的话，那这个类加载器默认就是应用程序类加载器）</p></blockquote><p>以SPI为例：</p><blockquote><p>SPI全称是 Service Provider Interface，是 Java 提供的一套用来被第三方实现或者扩展的 API，它可以用来启用框架扩展和替换组件。</p><p>简而言之，通过在 META-INF&#x2F;services 目录下，创建一个以接口全限定名为命名的文件（内容为实现类的全限定名），即可自动加载这一种实现，其主要使用 <strong>java.util.ServiceLoader</strong> 类进行动态装载</p></blockquote><pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-language="java"><code class="language-java"><span class="token keyword">package</span>

alt="image-20220126171854523"></p></li><li><p>第三次破坏：</p><blockquote><p>由于用户对程序动态性的追求而导致的，即热更新，热部署等。出现了OSGi，其自定义了类加载器机制的实现，不再是双亲委派模型的树形结构，而是更加复杂的网状结构</p></blockquote></li></ol>]]></content>

title="常量池"></a>常量池</h4><p>接着版本号之后的就是常量池，是占用Class文件空间最大的数据项目之一，也是第一个出现的表类型数据项目，常量池中的每一项常量都是一个表。由于常量池中常量的数量并不固定，因此在入口放置了一个u2类型的数据，代表常量池容量计数值（从1开始计数）。</p><p><img

alt="访问标志"></p><p>在上述代码中，Hello只是一个用public修饰的普通Java类，因此访问标志只有<code>ACC_PUBLIC</code>和<code>ACC_SUPER</code>为true，即0x0001 | 0x0020 &#x3D; 0x0021，符合下图：</p><p><img

title="类索引、父类索引与接口索引集合"></a>类索引、父类索引与接口索引集合</h4><p>类索引（this_class）和父类索引（super_class）都是一个u2类型的数据，而接口索引集合（interfaces）是一组u2类型的数据的集合，Class文件中由这三项数据来确定该类型的继承关系。类索引用于确定这个类的全限定名，父类索引用于确定这个类的父类的全限定名，接口索引集合用于描述该类实现了哪些接口。</p><p>由图中可以看到类索引是3，父类索引是4，接口索引集合大小是0：</p><p><img

alt="image-20220120151831396"></p><p>结合16进制编码查看，<code>fields_count</code>是容量计数器，0x0001表示只有一个字段表数据；<code>access_flags</code>是访问标志，值是0x0002，结合上图可以知道表示的是private修饰符；<code>name_index</code>索引是0x0005，结合常量池图看可以知道是代表字段值名称m；<code>descriptor_index</code>索引是0x0006，同理可知道其值是I(代表的是基本数据类型int)</p><p><img

title="方法表集合"></a>方法表集合</h4><p>方法表集合与字段表集合类似，<code>methods_count</code>代表的是方法容量计数器，0x0002表示有两个方法（默认的构造器init和自定义的inc）；<code>access_flags=0x0001</code>表示的是public修饰符；<code>name_index</code>索引值是0x0007，结合常量池图发现代表的正是init方法；<code>descriptor_index</code>的索引值是0x0008，对应常量”()V”；<code>attributes_count</code>表示属性表中有一项属性；<code>attribute_name_index</code>索引值是0x0009，对应常量”Code”（虚拟机规范中预定义的属性），表示的是此属性是方法的字节码描述</p><p><img

alt="image-20220120161237537"></p><p>接着查看常量表部分后的内容，结合代码发现，无论是init还是inc方法都并没有传入任何参数，但args_size&#x3D;1，这是因为在任何实例方法里面，都可以通过“this”关键字访问到此方法所属的对象，而且只对实例方法有效，因此都会默认传入this；当把inc方法使用static修饰时（此时方法属于类），args_size&#x3D;0</p><p><img

Parameters查看堆中信息，由于VM参数指定使用的是SerialGC（不指定默认为G1收集器），所以可以看到典型的分代布局：Eden，From，To，Old；以及它们各自的虚拟内存地址起止范围</p><p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/23/b059934725c18189.png"

But with so much online content to consume and so little time to consume it, editors at news outlets know that writing “catchy” headlines is more important than ever. So, what makes a headline catchy? A new study published in Nature Human Behaviour found that negative emotion words in headlines made it more likely that consumers would click through and read the story. In contrast, positive emotion words decreased click rates.</p><p>The idea that people are more attentive to negative things is not a new one. Journalists have always had this intuition (captured in phrases like “if it bleeds, it leads”), and psychology studies have backed it up. People dislike losses more than they like gains, and they overweigh negative information in many contexts. Even infants pay more attention to negative stimuli. This negativity bias makes some sense from an evolutionary perspective: If you miss out on an opportunity to forage for some delicious berries, you will be sad…but if you accidentally eat a poison mushroom, you will be dead.</p><p>Given this negativity bias, do people tend to engage more with negative news content online? Previous research suggests that the answer is yes. For example, people share more content if it makes them angry. But a lot of this research has been done either in a controlled lab setting, or it has been correlational, so we can’t know for sure if negativity actually causes people to consume news more.</p><p>That’s why the dataset analyzed by Robertson and colleagues is so special. First of all, it is data on the number of clicks (“click-through rate” is the technical term) in response to &gt;105,000 headlines on the news site Upworthy. Therefore, these are real decisions being made by real people. Moreover, Upworthy often tested out (through random assignment) different headlines for the same exact story, so they essentially ran experiments on their users. Therefore, even when the content of the news story was exactly the same, when editors put negative words like “hate” and “worst” into the headline, more people clicked on it, and when they included positive words like “love,” and “best,” fewer people clicked through.</p><p>Not only does this paper tell us more about the factors that influence online news consumption, but it also showcases the nuanced ways in which emotion influences decision-making. The researchers found that words about sadness increased click-through rates, but words about fear actually decreased them (and anger words had no significant effect). Now, we don’t know if people were actually feeling those emotions when they read the headlines, so we will need more studies to explore these effects further.</p><p>However, given that different discrete emotions might be associated with different appraisals of one’s current situation, it makes sense that not all negative emotions would have the same downstream effects on behavior. For example, previous research has shown that people are more optimistic and risk-seeking when they are angry, but they are more pessimistic and risk-averse when they are afraid.</p><p>In the future, it will be interesting to see how generalizable these findings are. For instance, this study did not look at individual differences in news consumption, and it is possible that the results would depend on the reader’s personality or age (e.g., older adults are less susceptible to negativity bias). But I’m excited about the trend of psychologists digging into real-world decision-making data to gain insights into the ways that emotion impacts decision-making.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>click-through rate</em> 点击率</p><p><em>catchy</em> 引人注意的，容易记住的，动人的</p><p><em>attentive</em> 专心的，注意点，留心的</p><p><em>intuition</em> 直觉</p><p><em>capture</em> 赢得，获得，取得；描绘，刻画；拍摄，摄制</p><p><em>phrase</em> 短语，说法，警句</p><p><em>if it bleeds, it leads</em> 新闻媒体倾向于报道负面事件（可吸引更多关注）</p><p><em>stimuli</em> 刺激物，促进因素</p><p><em>evolutionary</em> 演变的，进化的</p><p><em>perspective</em> 前途，观点，看法</p><p><em>poison</em> 毒物</p><p><em>correlational</em> 互为相关，相关性的</p><p><em>essentially</em> 本质上，基本上，根本上，实际上</p><p><em>showcase</em> 充分展示，展示…的优点</p><p><em>nuanced</em> 细微差别<br><em>significant</em> 显著，重要，明显</p><p><em>make sense</em> 有道理，有意义</p><p><em>discrete</em> 独立的，各自的，独自的，离散的</p><p><em>appraisal</em> 评定，鉴定，估价，评价</p><p><em>downstream</em> 顺流地，向下游地；后阶段地</p><p><em>pessimistic</em> 悲观的</p><p><em>risk-averse</em> 规避风险</p><p><em>generalizable</em> 可归纳的，可推广的，可概括性</p><p><em>susceptible</em> 敏感，过敏，易受影响</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>最近一项研究表明带有负面词汇标题可以给文章带来显著的点击率提升，文章围绕该项研究做出了较详细的叙述</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>我对文章的观点表示赞同，因为结合我考研时看过的B站某些视频，制造焦虑是很容易获得大量关注度的，其播放量往往也是最高的，这确是一大流量密码，可是这种行为实在可耻，考研本来就不是一件易事，还在别人迷茫寻找路线的时候给他人制造恐慌，制造焦虑绝对是不道德行为。</p><p>因此，打破焦虑最好的办法就是行动起来，多读书多看报，少看B站多睡觉。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

For instance, positive gossip concerning job-related behavior, such as saying the person worked well under pressure, increased the participants’ willingness to give a work-related benefit compared to gossip about family relationships.</p><p>The researchers ran the experiment with 120 online participants workers in the U.S. and India, and after making some culturally appropriate adjustments, with 160 Ngandu horticulturalists, who make a living from small gardens in the Central African Republic. In all three groups, they found similar results.</p><p>“Gossip seems context relevant. People don’t just say random things,” said Nicole Hess, a WSU anthropologist and lead author on the study published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior. “Gossip that was relevant to the exchange and the relationship had the most impact on whether a person gave a resource, or not.”</p><p>Anthropologists consider gossip, defined as exchanging reputational information about other community members, to be a feature of almost every human society, but it is less clear what function it serves. Some argue that talking about other people this way helps enforce social norms or serves as social bonding between the gossipers. This study lends evidence to yet another theory: that gossip is used competitively because it shows a direct relationship between gossip and the likelihood of receiving more resources.</p><p>“Up until this study, no one had even really asked ‘what is the end result of gossip?’ Gossip makes a person’s reputation worse or better, so what is the result?” Hess said. “These findings support the competitive evolutionary model: that people are using gossip to compete with each other over valuable resources in their communities.”</p><p>For this study, Hess and co-author Ed Hagen, also a WSU anthropologist, developed a set of experiments that provided participants with job- or family-related scenarios. For the office workers in the industrialized countries, the scenarios described a situation where they could either give a raise to one of their co-workers or an inherited painting to a family member.</p><p>They then were given a mix of gossip statements about how a theoretical co-worker or relative behaved at work or dealt with their family. For example, the work statement might be about whether the colleague was willing to work late to finish a project, or on the family side, whether they got along well with their siblings.</p><p>After reading a mix of these statements, the participants were asked whether they were willing to give that fictional person the resource.</p><p>For the Ngandu farmers, the work scenario was adjusted to have them evaluate a fictional worker they hired to help with their garden, and whether they would share some shirts with the worker that a produce buyer had given them. The family scenario involved deciding whether to give a relative some nice clothes the participant had inherited.</p><p>Both surveys showed a similar pattern: participants were more willing to give the resource when exposed to more positive, context-specific gossip statements about them, and less willing when exposed to more negative, context-specific gossip statements.</p><p>In this paper, the researchers also included an observational study of 40 Aka hunter-gatherers who live near the Ngandu horticulturists. This study was designed as a series of questions asked verbally about real people the participants knew, which increased the study’s ecological validity, meaning it shows that the results can be generalized to real-life settings.</p><p>While not exactly parallel with the experimental studies, these observational results also indicated that an individual’s positive reputation strongly influenced whether the Aka participants were willing to share a resource with them.</p><p>“The cultural contexts are different, but they have the same patterns of responses,” said Hess. “This appears to be the universal psychology in how people evaluate reputation in allocating valuable things from industrial societies to small scale communities.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>anthropologist</em> 人类学家</p><p><em>heirloom</em> 传家宝，祖传之物</p><p><em>horticulturist</em> 园艺家，园艺师</p><p><em>make a living</em> 谋生</p><p><em>context</em> 背景，环境；上下文，语境</p><p><em>reputational</em> 声誉的，名誉的</p><p><em>enforce</em> 实行，执行，把…强加于</p><p><em>norm</em> 规范，行为标准</p><p><em>lend</em> 增添，增加</p><p><em>inherit</em> 继承；遗传得到</p><p><em>produce</em> 农产品</p><p><em>hunter-gatherer</em> 采猎者，狩猎采集者</p><p><em>verbally</em> 口头上</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>老实说，这篇文章看翻译都感觉不是很理解，实在是没搞懂八卦和资源分配有什么关系？（流下没技术的眼泪.jpg）</p></blockquote>]]></content>

These results “open an avenue in the significance of reducing fried food consumption for mental health,” according to the paper published Monday in the journal PNAS.</p><p>However, experts who study nutrition said the results are preliminary, and it’s not necessarily clear whether the fried foods were driving mental health issues, or people experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety turned to fried foods.</p><p>The study evaluated 140,728 people over 11.3 years. After excluding participants diagnosed with depression within the first two years, a total of 8,294 cases of anxiety and 12,735 cases of depression were found in those that consumed fried food, while specifically fried potatoes were found to have a 2% increase in risk of depression over fried white meat.</p><p>The study had also found that the participants consuming more than one serving of fried food regularly were more likely to be younger men.</p><p>“The human component of this study may indicate just what it purports: that higher intake of fried food increases the risk of anxiety&#x2F;depression,” said Dr. David Katz, a lifestyle medicine specialist who was not involved in the study, via email.</p><p>“However, the causal pathway could just as readily go the other way: people with anxiety&#x2F;depression turn to ‘comfort food’ with increasing frequency for some semblance of relief,” added Katz, founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.</p><p>Those with underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression could turn to comfort foods as a way of self-medicating, he said.</p><p>Unhealthy food and poor nutrition can lower one’s mood and progress a mental health condition, as found in a prior study cited within this new one.</p><p><strong>The same goes for zebrafish</strong></p><p>In the new study, the researchers suggest that acrylamide, a chemical formed during the frying process, especially in fried potatoes, is to blame for the higher risk of anxiety and depression.</p><p>In a separate paper referenced in the new study, the researchers exposed zebrafish to the chemical, finding that long-term exposure had caused the fish to dwell in dark zones within the tank, a common sign of a higher anxiety level in the fish.</p><p>The zebrafish had also displayed a reduced ability to explore their tanks and socialize, as they did not swim closely with other zebrafish, even though zebrafish are known to form schools with their species.</p><p>“Zebrafish were presumably chosen … because they were already known to be vulnerable to acrylamide toxicity, and because their behavioral responses to anxiety are established and consistent — offering a source of both biological and behavioral data,” Katz said.</p><p>Dr. Walter Willett said the results “should be regarded as very preliminary, especially the connection with fried food and acrylamide.”</p><p><strong>Anxiety and depression on the rise</strong></p><p>Zhejiang University researcher Yu Zhang, an author of the study, told CNN in an email that “there is no need to panic about the adverse effects of fried food.” But maintaining a healthy lifestyle and reducing consumption of fried foods may be helpful for mental health in additional to overall health.</p><p>The researchers had pointed to a recent rise in depression and anxiety worldwide, with 2020 seeing an increase of 27.6% and 25.6%, respectively. The World Health Organization also estimates that more than 5% of adults suffer from depression, globally, as noted in the paper.</p><p>By looking at the effects of fried food consumption in humans and acrylamide exposure in zebrafish, the researchers had compared the two to suggest that frequent consumption of the chemical commonly found in fried food could have a negative effect on mental health.</p><p>A lack of variety in food has also been shown to decrease well-being, according to Katz.</p><p>“If a take-away is needed it is simply that overall diet quality, and the selection of wholesome foods, matters profoundly to every aspect of health — mental and physical alike,” Katz said.</p><p>Willett said there’s also the possibility of reverse causation — that people may change their diets because they have depression or anxiety. “These mood changes are, in general, more difficult to study because they may come and go, unlike the diagnosis of a major cancer or heart attack, the study was not designed to address these challenges,” he said.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>greasy</em> 油腻的；多油的，油污的；油性的</p><p><em>starchy</em> 淀粉的；刻板的，拘谨的</p><p><em>comfort food</em> 开心食品，安慰食品</p><p><em>pronounced</em> 明显的，明确的</p><p><em>preliminary</em> 初步的，预备性的，开始的</p><p><em>serving</em> 一份，一客；现役的</p><p><em>component</em> 组成部分，成分</p><p><em>purport</em> 自称，标榜，声称</p><p><em>intake</em> 摄入量</p><p><em>causal</em> 因果关系</p><p><em>semblance</em> 表象，假象；外观，外貌</p><p><em>coalition</em> 联盟，同盟，联合体</p><p><em>dwell</em> 居住，栖身</p><p><em>presumably</em> 大概，可能</p><p><em>toxicity</em> 毒性</p><p><em>established</em> 著名的；已确立的；既定的</p><p><em>adverse</em> 不利的，有害的</p><p><em>take-away</em> 外卖；要点，从···中了解到的主要信息</p><p><em>wholesome</em> 有益健康的，有益的，有道德的</p><p><em>causation</em> 因果关系</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>无论怎样，油炸的东西吃多了都是不太健康的，凡事讲究的是适可而止，马原也有说过要把握好度。</p><p>可是油炸食品吃起来真的好开心哦😄</p></blockquote>]]></content>

A new study details how manipulating the Arrdc5 gene in mice led to infertility in males, and scientists say that a drug targeting this gene could be a sorely needed solution to the massive disparity between male and female contraceptive options.</p><p>Few scientific questions have the same power to capture our interest and spark debate as the promise of a male contraceptive drug. The idea has been years in the making, but progress has been frustratingly slow. In the meantime, the burden of contraceptive planning overwhelmingly falls on the shoulders of women. </p><p>But not all women have access to a form of birth control that is suitable for them, and the United Nations estimates that almost half of all pregnancies worldwide are unplanned – this, against a backdrop of ever more barriers to accessing abortion and prenatal healthcare across the globe, thrown into particularly stark relief by the overturning of Roe vs Wade in the US.</p><p>New options for contraceptives targeted at the male reproductive system would therefore be hugely welcome. Researchers from Washington State University recently identified a gene, called Arrdc5, which could prove to be a potent target in the development of new birth control drugs.</p><p>“The study identifies this gene for the first time as being expressed only in testicular tissue, nowhere else in the body, and it’s expressed by multiple mammalian species,” said senior author Jon Oatley in a statement. This is what makes Arrdc5 stand out from other potential drug targets that have previously been found.</p><p>The researchers knocked out the Arrdc5 gene in mice to investigate the effects this would have on their fertility. The male mice lacking the gene produced 28 percent less sperm and the swimmers they did produce had lower motility, moving 2.8 times slower than usual. Not only that, 98 percent of the sperm had abnormalities in their heads and mid-pieces, rendering them unable to fertilize an egg.</p><p>The name for this collection of irregularities in sperm is oligoasthenoteratospermia (OAT), and it’s a common reason for infertility in humans. Up to now, the causes of this condition have not been clear, but the authors write that their findings around the Arrdc5 gene raise “the intriguing possibility that deleterious mutations could be underlying causes of fertility defects.”</p><p>As to potentially targeting the gene with a birth control drug, a huge advantage would be the lack of hormonal involvement. Testosterone plays many important roles in the male body beyond the reproductive system, so achieving a contraceptive effect without disrupting testosterone would be ideal. The authors also highlighted that it should be easy to engineer any such new drug to be reversible.</p><p>“You don’t want to wipe out the ability to ever make sperm – just stop the sperm that are being made from being made correctly,” Oatley explained. “Then, in theory, you could remove the drug and the sperm would start being built normally again.”</p><p>Work based on these initial findings is already underway, with Oatley and first author Mariana Giassetti having filed a provisional patent for the development of a contraceptive based on their discovery. Since the Arrdc5 gene is found in many species, this research could have broader implications, such as for population control in livestock; but for now, the team has their sights firmly set on the human side of things.</p><p>“Right now, we don’t really have anything on the male side for contraception other than surgery,” said Oatley. “If we can develop this discovery into a solution for contraception, it could have far-ranging impacts.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>testicle</em> 睾丸</p><p><em>mammal</em> 哺乳动物</p><p><em>reversible</em> 可逆的</p><p><em>hormonal</em> 和激素相关的</p><p><em>contraception</em> 避孕，节育</p><p><em>manipulate</em> 操纵，控制</p><p><em>infertility</em> 不孕，不肥沃，贫瘠</p><p><em>sorely</em> 极其，非常</p><p><em>disparity</em> 不同，差异（尤指不公平的）</p><p><em>contraceptive</em> 避孕药，避孕用具</p><p><em>spark</em> 激发，引发<br><em>in the making</em> 完成，制造成，制作成</p><p><em>overwhelmingly</em> 压倒性地，不可抵抗地</p><p><em>backdrop</em> 背景幕布，事情的背景，背景</p><p><em>abortion</em> 流产，堕胎</p><p><em>prenatal</em> 产前的</p><p><em>stark</em> 明显的，鲜明的；赤裸裸的，严酷的</p><p><em>relief</em> 宽心，宽慰，轻松，解脱；救济品，救济金；浮雕</p><p><em>reproductive</em> 生殖，生育，繁殖</p><p><em>potent</em> 强有力的，强大的</p><p><em>motility</em> 运动性，机动性</p><p><em>abnormality</em> 反常，异常，变态</p><p><em>render</em> 翻译；以某种方式表达；使成为，使变得；给予，提供；粉刷墙壁</p><p><em>fertilize</em> 使受精；使受孕；施肥</p><p><em>intriguing</em> 引人入胜的，非常有趣的，神秘的</p><p><em>deleterious</em> 有害的，造成伤害的，损害的</p><p><em>mutation</em> 变异，突变</p><p><em>underlying</em> 潜在的，暗含的，深层的；以…为基础的</p><p><em>testosterone</em> 睾酮</p><p><em>wipe out</em> 消灭，摧毁，使灭绝</p><p><em>file</em> 提起诉讼，提出申请，送交备案</p><p><em>provisional</em> 暂时的，临时的</p><p><em>livestock</em> 家畜，家禽</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>科技的进步带来的便利。现在避孕主要一就是避孕套，二就是女性事前或事后食药，副作用大，若然此研究能够落实，而且真的是可逆不会造成伤害的话，绝对是一大成就。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

They included Mr Bean’s Holiday and Sister Act, as well as horror films such as The Grudge.</p><p>Once the sweat had been collected, researchers recruited 48 women, all of whom suffered from social anxiety, and divided them into three groups each of 16 people. Over two days, they all underwent mindfulness therapy for social anxiety. At the same time, each group was exposed to the odour samples or to clean air.</p><p>The study found that the women who had been exposed to the odour samples responded better to the therapy.</p><p>Patients who undertook one treatment session of mindfulness therapy together with being exposed to human body odours showed about 39% reduction in anxiety scores. There was a 17% reduction in anxiety scores after one treatment session in the group receiving only the therapy.</p><p>Vigna said: “We were a little surprised to find that the emotional state of the person producing the sweat didn’t differ in treatment outcomes: sweat produced while someone was happy had the same effect as someone who had been scared by a movie clip.</p><p>“So there may be something about human chemo-signals in sweat generally which affects the response to treatment. It may be that simply being exposed to the presence of someone else has this effect, but we need to confirm this.”</p><p>The NHS describes social anxiety as a long-term and overwhelming fear of social situations. Treatments at present include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a therapist and antidepressant medicines.</p><p>Previous research has suggested that an estimated 12.1% of adults in the US experience social anxiety disorder at some point.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>mindfulness</em> 正念认知</p><p><em>odour</em> 气味，臭味</p><p><em>excessively</em> 过度地，过分地，过量地</p><p><em>molecule</em> 分子</p><p><em>chemo-</em> 化学的</p><p><em>preliminary</em> 预备性的，初步的，开始的</p><p><em>congress</em> 代表大会，国会</p><p><em>psychiatry</em> 精神病学</p><p><em>extract</em> 取出，拔出，提取</p><p><em>elicit</em> 探出，引出</p><p><em>grudge</em> 怨恨，积怨</p><p><em>undergo</em> 经历，经受</p><p><em>overwhelming</em> 难以抵挡的，无法抗拒的</p><p><em>cognitive</em> 认知的，感知的</p><p><em>antidepressant</em> 抗抑郁药的</p><p><em>disorder</em> 混乱，凌乱，杂乱无章；失调</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>这意思是说闻到他人的汗液味就会不那么紧张了？😄，有点奇怪的研究</p></blockquote>]]></content>

China braces for record May Day holiday rush</strong></h1><hr><p>China is bracing for a record-high travel rush over the Labour Day holiday, with popular sightseeing spots selling out of tickets and some cities warning would-be visitors away as domestic tourism rebounds after Beijing ended COVID curbs.</p><p>Authorities are expecting 19 million trips to be made across China’s vast railway network on Saturday, the first day of the five-day holiday, which would be the highest number of rail trips made in a single day in the country’s history.</p><p>It compares to 4.4 million rail trips on May 1 last year, when China locked down several cities including Shanghai to battle the spread of the virus, and the last peak of 18.8 million on the same day in 2021.</p><p>Over the 40-day Lunar New Year travel period in January-February this year, 348 million trips were made in total, or about 8.7 million trips a day on average, according to the National Railway Administration.</p><p>The May holiday is far shorter than the Lunar New Year and October Golden Week holidays but traditionally still is one of China’s busiest travel seasons as spring moves into summer. This year, the holiday is crucial for the tourism industry as well as the wider Chinese economy as the country strives to recover from years of virus disruptions.</p><p>“It took me a lot of effort to get a ticket, it’s hard this time,” said Di Jingshu, 21, as she waited for a train at Shanghai’s packed Hongqiao railway station on Thursday. China’s aviation authority said it expects air passenger trips to reach a total of 9 million over the five days.</p><p>Booking sites for popular scenic spots, such as Beijing’s Old Summer Palace and the Badaling section of the Great Wall showed they were sold out of tickets for the first few days of the Labour Day holiday, and Trip.com Group said that reservations across its online travel platform had surpassed 2019 levels.</p><p>One small city, Zibo in China’s coastal Shandong province, which has gone viral on Chinese social media in recent weeks for its local barbecue cuisine, imposed an upper limit on Sunday on hotel room rates and three days later issued a public letter warning would-be visitors its downtown hotels were fully booked.</p><p>“Passenger traffic has exceeded our accommodation capacity,” it said, pleading for understanding should service levels fall short given the anticipated swelling of visitor numbers.</p><p>Outbound travel for the holiday however continues to remain constrained, in part due to a shortage of international flights, although bright spots were emerging in cities such as Macau and Jakarta, according to a report from travel data firm ForwardKeys.</p><p>“Bookings for outbound travel are around 50% behind the pre-pandemic levels,” it said. “Chinese travellers have started to travel abroad but are still preferring destinations within the Asia Pacific region.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>brace for</em> 做准备，准备迎接（令人不快的事）</p><p><em>rush</em> 猛冲，急速流动；一阵强烈感情，一阵感觉，情绪迸发；忙乱，忙碌；争抢；蜂拥前往，蜂拥的人潮</p><p><em>would-be</em> 想要做···的，试图成为···的，未来的</p><p><em>rebound</em> 弹回，反弹，跳回</p><p><em>curb</em> 限制，抑制</p><p><em>lock down</em> 对出行、社交和进入公共场所实行严格限制</p><p><em>peak</em> 顶峰，顶点</p><p><em>packed</em> 挤满的，拥挤的</p><p><em>aviation</em> 航空学，飞行术，航空工业</p><p><em>reservation</em> 存疑，保留意见，异议；预订，预约；野生动物保护区，自然保护区</p><p><em>surpass</em> 优于，超过</p><p><em>coastal</em> 沿海的</p><p><em>viral</em> 病毒式的</p><p><em>cuisine</em> 饭菜，菜肴，烹调风格</p><p><em>swell</em> 增大，肿胀</p><p><em>outbound</em> 向外的，离港的，离开某地的</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人记录"><a href="#个人记录" class="headerlink" title="个人记录"></a>个人记录</h2><blockquote><p>年年都是人挤人，有钱的亲临现场周游列国，没钱的坐电视机前周游列国，大家都有光明的未来。</p><p>PS：都说经济形势不太行，最后才发现小丑竟是我自己 🌚</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Should you take them all at once and indulge in a lavish vacation blowout? Should you spread them out into little mini-breaks, or even use them to give yourself lots and lots of long weekends?</p><p>It’s a question every professional must answer, and while the nature of your work, the size of your budget, and the preferences of your family all play a role in deciding what sort of holiday to take, science also has something to say on the issue. Studies have identified an ideal length of time to get away to maximize the relaxation bang you get for your vacation buck.</p><p><strong>Eight days to peak vacation joy.</strong></p><p>The research out of a Finnish university followed 54 holidaymakers throughout the duration of their getaways, measuring the highs and lows of their happiness and satisfaction as their vacations progressed. The researchers discovered that vacation-related joy didn’t climb ever upward as tourists’ tans deepened and work receded to a distant memory. In contrast, happiness peaked after eight days away.</p><p>“It could be that eight days is the ideal to fully gain the benefits of a holiday,” Jessica de Bloom, a member of the research team, told The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The idea that a little more than a week is the perfect vacation length sits well with other seasoned vacationers. “Eight days. Seems about right. You take off on a Friday after work, maybe sneak out a little early. You then have Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,” HR expert Tim Sackett wrote, commenting on the study on his blog.</p><p>“That first day never seems like a vacation as you get settled in and try to unwind and that last Saturday you need to start packing and getting stuff together because you leave on Sunday. That final Sunday might as well be a work day because you definitely aren’t on vacation any longer!” he added, explaining why the week-and-a-bit duration appealed to him.</p><p><strong>The science of the perfect getaway.</strong></p><p>It’s a finding worth noting if you’re planning a last-minute summer getaway. Travel is expensive, after all (and, if you have kids, not exactly stress free), so there’s no point prolonging a trip if the extra time and money spent isn’t going to add to your happiness or relaxation levels. But this study isn’t the only scientific insight available on how to take the best possible vacation. Happiness experts have plenty of other tips to offer on how to get the most joy out of your vacation, while other research shows how to squeeze every last drop of enjoyment out of your holiday.</p><p>How long is the ideal vacation in your opinion?</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>get away</em> 常指因需要休息而外出度假</p><p><em>indulge</em> 沉溺于，放纵</p><p><em>lavish</em> 大量的，使人印象深刻的，昂贵的，慷慨的，大方的</p><p><em>blowout</em> 盛宴</p><p><em>mini-break</em> 短假</p><p><em>buck</em> 美元；许多钱；抵制，反抗</p><p><em>tan</em> 晒成棕褐色的肤色</p><p><em>sit right&#x2F;well with sb</em> 某人可接受；受某人欢迎</p><p><em>seasoned</em> 经验丰富的，老到的</p><p><em>settle in</em> 安顿下来，适应新环境</p><p><em>unwind</em> 解开，打开；放松，轻松</p><p><em>last-minute</em> 最后一分钟才完成（或决定，安排好等）；紧急关头的</p><p><em>insight</em> 洞察力，深刻见解</p><p><em>squeeze</em> 挤压；挤进；给···带来财务困难</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>工作时想放假，放假时想工作。</p><p>如果问我理想假期是几天，我的回答是一辈子😄（前提得有钱，没钱都活不下去了还想放假）。</p><p>有一说一，放假太久真的会很空虚，整天无所事事的，不如找点事做充实一下。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Jean Carroll, now 79, that Trump raped her in the dressing room of an upscale department store in New York sometime in 1996. But it concluded that he sexually abused her, awarding her $2 million on that allegation.</p><p>It awarded Carroll another $3 million for Trump’s repeated claims publicly and on his social media accounts that her allegations were “a scam” and “a complete con job.”</p><p>Carroll emerged from the courthouse smiling but did not stop to talk to a gaggle of news reporters.</p><p>A woman yelled to her, “You’re so brave and beautiful,” to which Carroll said, “Thank you, thank you so much.”</p><p>Later, she said in a statement, “I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.”</p><p>‘Bogus case’</p><p>Trump slammed the decision, insisting he is the subject of a witch hunt.</p><p>“This verdict is a disgrace — a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time,” the former president posted, using all capital letters, on his Truth Social media platform.</p><p>“I have absolutely no idea who this woman is,” he said of Carroll.</p><p>The Trump campaign promoting his 2024 run for the Republican presidential nomination said, “Make no mistake, this entire bogus case is a political endeavor targeting President Trump because he is now an overwhelming front-runner to be once again elected president of the United States.”</p><p>Trump defense lawyer Joseph Tacopina said the former president would appeal the outcome, with the lawyer adding that he believes there are “plenty of issues” on which to try to overturn the verdict.</p><p>Tacopina said he does not believe Trump can get a fair trial in New York, which, even though Trump grew up and lived in the city for decades, voted overwhelmingly against him in his two previous campaigns for the White House.</p><p>Trump lost his 2020 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden and now is facing several criminal investigations stemming from his efforts to overturn that election outcome and his retention of classified documents from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p><p>But the allegations made by Carroll were adjudicated in a civil, not criminal case, and as a result carried no threat of a conviction or imprisonment for the 76-year-old Trump.</p><p>Trump did not appear in the courtroom to hear Carroll’s account nor was he required to. Two other women testified on her behalf that Trump assaulted them decades ago in similar fashion: A onetime stock broker said he groped her in the first-class cabin of a New York-bound flight, and a journalist alleged that he suddenly started kissing her at Mar-a-Lago while she was there to report a story for People magazine on the first anniversary of his marriage to his third wife, former first lady Melania Trump.</p><p>Tacopina called no defense witnesses in the case and instead tried to chip away at Carroll’s account of the incident, noting that she could not remember the exact date the attack occurred, never reported it to police at the time nor went to a hospital for treatment, and only first made her allegation public in a 2019 memoir.</p><p>“It’s the most ridiculous, disgusting story. It’s just made up,” Tacopina told the jurors in his closing argument on Monday. Earlier, as the case opened two weeks ago, Tacopina said, “There are no witnesses to call to prove a negative” and that jurors would have to “believe the unbelievable” to rule in favor of Carroll, who sought a retraction of Trump’s denial of the incident and unspecified monetary damages.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>jury</em> 陪审团，裁判团，评判委员会</p><p><em>columnist</em> 专栏作家</p><p><em>liable</em> 承担责任的，负有法律责任的</p><p><em>defame</em> 诽谤，诋毁</p><p><em>dismiss</em> 对···不予理会，摒弃，去除；解雇，开除，免职</p><p><em>hoax</em> 骗局</p><p><em>deliberation</em> 讨论，商议，细想，考虑</p><p><em>trial</em> 审判，审讯；试验，试用</p><p><em>allegation</em> 指控，指责</p><p><em>upscale</em> 高档的，高级的</p><p><em>con</em> 骗局，圈套，花招</p><p><em>gaggle</em> 一群喧闹的人，一帮蠢人</p><p><em>bogus</em> 假冒的，伪造的</p><p><em>slam</em> 严厉抨击</p><p><em>witch hunt</em> 政治迫害</p><p><em>disgrace</em> 耻辱，丢脸，不光彩的行为</p><p><em>continuation</em> 持续，继续，延续</p><p><em>capital letter</em> 大写字母</p><p><em>make no mistake</em> 完全可以肯定，没有半点怀疑</p><p><em>endeavor</em> 努力，奋力</p><p><em>front-runner</em> 领跑者</p><p><em>appeal</em> 上诉，申诉，异议；对···有感染力，引起兴趣</p><p><em>retention</em> 保留，保持，维持</p><p><em>classified</em> 机密的，保密的</p><p><em>adjudicate</em> 裁决，裁定，判决</p><p><em>conviction</em> 定罪，判罪；坚定的看法，坚定的信仰</p><p><em>imprisonment</em> 囚禁，服刑，刑期</p><p><em>account</em> 报道，报告，记述，描述</p><p><em>testify</em> 证明，作证，证实</p><p><em>assault</em> 袭击，攻击</p><p><em>stockbroker</em> 股票经纪人</p><p><em>grope</em> 猥亵</p><p><em>chip away at sth</em> 逐渐削弱或减少，一点点地除掉</p><p><em>memoir</em> 回忆录，自传</p><p><em>juror</em> 陪审员</p><p><em>retraction</em> 撤销，收回</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p> 🍉吃瓜，不予置评</p>]]></content>

Reports say it could come next week.</p><p>If he is indicted, it would be the first criminal case ever brought against a former US president.</p><p>This case focuses on alleged hush money paid on Mr Trump’s behalf by his lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>It is one of several cases in which the 76-year-old is currently being investigated, although he has not yet been charged in any and denies wrongdoing in each.</p><p>Mr Trump has pledged to continue his campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, even if he is indicted.</p><p>Past efforts to investigate him, including two impeachment trials, the Russia investigation and the Mar-a-Lago raid, have tended to make him more popular with his base, so an indictment could have a similar effect.</p><p>It is not yet known if he is going to be criminally charged this week or even, beyond broad strokes, what those charges might be.</p><p>But with the former president predicting an arrest, and calling for mass protests, this is a journey into unknown territory.</p><p>Mr Trump has a loyal base of followers, and the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters following his repeated calls to protest has proven that a fraught situation can quickly escalate into violence.</p><p>On Saturday Mr Trump wrote on his social networking site Truth Social that “illegal leaks” from the Manhattan district attorney’s office “indicate” he would be arrested on Tuesday.</p><p>The district attorney’s office has not yet commented. Mr Trump’s lawyer, Susan Necheles, said her team had not heard anything from law enforcement officials.</p><p>“Since this is a political prosecution, the district attorney’s office has engaged in a practice of leaking everything to the press, rather than communicating with President Trump’s attorneys as would be done in a normal case,” she said.</p><p>The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, has hit out at the investigation, calling it “an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA [district attorney]”.</p><p>In a tweet, he also promised to investigate whether federal money was being used to interfere in elections “with politically motivated prosecutions”.</p><p>Any indictment would create a complicated calculation for Mr Trump’s rivals within the Republican Party, as they decide whether to up their attacks on the former president while he is potentially distracted or keep their heads down and hope for the best.</p><p>If history is any guide, it will be the latter.</p><p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p><p>• Grand jury finishes its investigation </p><p>Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and ex-aides Kellyanne Conway and Hope Hicks, are among those understood to have given evidence so far. The Trump team has said the former president declined an invitation to appear, a sign the case is almost over, according to experts. Reports suggest one final witness could give evidence, possibly on Monday.</p><p>• Prosecutors decide whether to indict </p><p>Once the investigation is complete, the grand jury votes on whether to recommend criminal charges. However, their verdict is not binding. Ultimately, it is up to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to determine what, if any, charges to bring. There is no deadline for this. It is a legal decision - what does he believe can he prove beyond a reasonable doubt to win a conviction - but also a deeply political one.</p><p>• A possible Trump court appearance in New York </p><p>A former US president has never been indicted before but Mr Trump’s lawyer said he would follow normal procedure. Typically, a defendant is either arrested or surrenders to the authorities - if they are facing a more serious felony charge they would be handcuffed. They then have their photo and fingerprints taken. After an initial hearing - called an arraignment - a defendant in a white-collar crime case like this is usually released until the next court date.</p><p>The Stormy Daniels case is about how Mr Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen after Cohen paid Ms Daniels $130,000. The record for the payment reimbursing Cohen says the payment was for “legal fees”. Prosecutors may say this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, a misdemeanour in New York.</p><p>US media organisations say law enforcement agencies in New York are preparing for the possibility of Mr Trump being indicted and appearing in a Manhattan courtroom as early as next week.</p><p>According to the Associated Press, they are considering the practicalities of taking a former president into court, including questions around security.</p><p>Donald Trump faces a separate criminal investigation over efforts to overturn his narrow loss in the state of Georgia in the 2020 presidential election - though it is not known if the former president is being directly investigated.</p><p>The Department of Justice is also looking at whether classified government documents were handled incorrectly after Mr Trump left office, as well as broader efforts to undermine the results of the presidential election three years ago - including the 6 January attack.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>arrest</em> 逮捕，拘捕</p><p><em>protest</em> 反抗，抗议，示威，游行</p><p><em>law enforcement</em> 执法部门</p><p><em>prosecutor</em> 检察官，原告律师</p><p><em>indictment</em> 起诉，控诉，谴责</p><p><em>indict</em> 起诉，控告</p><p><em>allege</em> 声称</p><p><em>hush money</em> 封口费</p><p><em>porn</em> 色情</p><p><em>wrongdoing</em> 不当行为，违法行为</p><p><em>pledge</em> 发誓，承诺，抵押</p><p><em>campaign</em> 竞选，战役，运动</p><p><em>nominee</em> 候选人</p><p><em>impeachment</em> 弹劾，控告</p><p><em>trial</em> 审判，试验</p><p><em>raid</em> 突袭，突击检查，打劫</p><p><em>territory</em> 领土，地盘，领域</p><p><em>fraught</em> 充满（风险，问题），令人担忧的</p><p><em>attorney</em> 律师</p><p><em>prosecution</em> 起诉，控方，从事，进行，实施</p><p><em>hit out</em> 猛烈批评，严厉抨击</p><p><em>outrageous</em> 无耻的，无法接受的，吓人的，令人震惊的</p><p><em>radical</em> 激进的，极端的，根本的，彻底的</p><p><em>grand jury</em> 美国大陪审团</p><p><em>verdict</em> 判决，意见，结论</p><p><em>binding</em> 有约束力的</p><p><em>typically</em> 通常来说</p><p><em>defendant</em> 被告</p><p><em>surrender</em> 投降，放弃</p><p><em>felony</em> 重罪</p><p><em>handcuff</em> 給…戴手铐</p><p><em>arraignment</em> 传讯</p><p><em>reimburse</em> 偿还，补偿</p><p><em>falsify</em> 伪造，篡改</p><p><em>amount to sth</em> 等于，意味着，达到，总计</p><p><em>misdemeanour</em> 不端行为，不检点的举止，轻罪</p><p><em>practicalities</em> 可行性</p><p><em>narrow</em> 狭窄，微小的，勉强的</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>特朗普发文声称自己即将被捕，呼吁他的支持者发起抗议。文章介绍了事件的来龙去脉以及之后可能的走向。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p><del>难道是川建国卧底的事件败露了？</del>（滑稽😂）</p></blockquote>]]></content>

It’s so easy to technically <strong>know</strong> something (like ‘always have a snappy video hook’) but still forget to <strong>apply</strong> that knowledge.

Last summer, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced a new policy recommending that all parents read to their children from birth.</p><p>“A lot of parents assume that once kids begin to read independently, that now that is the best thing for them to do,” said Maggie McGuire, the vice president for a website for parents operated by Scholastic.</p><p>But reading aloud through elementary school seemed to be connected to a love of reading generally. According to the report, 41 percent of frequent readers ages 6 to 10 were read aloud to at home, while only 13 percent of infrequent readers were being read to.</p><p>Scholastic, which operates book fairs in schools and publishes popular children’s books including the Harry Potter and Captain Underpants series, has been commissioning the “Kids and Family Reading Report” since 2006. For the first time this year, the report, conducted by YouGov, a market research firm, looked at predictors that children of different ages would be frequent readers, defined as children who read books for fun five or more days a week.</p><p>Kristen Harmeling, a partner at YouGov who worked on the report, said that children in the survey frequently cited reading aloud as a special bonding time with their parents. As children age, “I don’t think that parents know how important that time and the role that it plays in children’s lives,” she said.</p><p>Of course, children who love to read are generally immersed in households with lots of books and parents who like to read. So while parents who read to their children later in elementary school may encourage those children to become frequent readers on their own, such behavior can also result from “a whole constellation of other things that goes on in those families,” said Timothy Shanahan, professor emeritus of urban education at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a past president of the International Reading Association.</p><p>There is not yet strong research that connects reading aloud at older ages to improved reading comprehension. But some literacy experts said that when parents or teachers read aloud to children even after they can read themselves, the children can hear more complex words or stories than they might tackle themselves.</p><p>“It’s this idea of marinating children in higher-level vocabulary,” said Pam Allyn, founder of LitWorld.Org, a nonprofit group that works to increase literacy among young people. “The read-aloud can really lift the child.”</p><p>Other literacy experts say the real value of reading to children is helping to develop background knowledge in all kinds of topics as well as exposure to sophisticated language.</p><p>“It wouldn’t have to be reading” to accomplish that, said Catherine Snow, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. “A two-minute conversation about something on television or something in a magazine or something that you’re reading yourself can also have some of the same positive effects as reading aloud.”</p><p>Although the Scholastic report found that teenagers were more likely to read frequently for fun if they had dedicated independent reading time in school, only 17 percent of all children surveyed reported having time to read a book of their choice at school daily. Just 10 percent of 12- to 14-year-olds and 4 percent of 15- to 17-year-olds reported having that time in class. Such reading time at school may be particularly important for low-income children, who reported that they were more likely to read for fun at school than at home.</p><p>While previous studies have shown little connection between independent reading time at school and better reading habits or comprehension, some large school districts, including Boston and Chicago, encourage teachers to include time in the day for students to pick books and read.</p><p>Parents also see a connection. Emily Skelding, a mother of four in New Orleans and a former middle school teacher, said that her eldest son, Sumner, 15, used to devour books as a child. But now that he has no time at school to read on his own — or perhaps more significant, to choose the books he wants to read — “he stopped reading for pleasure,” Ms. Skelding said.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>hand-writing</em> 绝望</p><p><em>distraction</em> 分心的事，分散注意力的东西</p><p><em>pattern</em> 模式，方式，形式；图案，花样</p><p><em>predictor</em> 预测因子，预测器</p><p><em>toddlerhood</em> 学步期</p><p><em>taper off</em> 逐渐减小，逐步减弱</p><p><em>pediatrics</em> 儿科学</p><p><em>assume</em> 假设，假定，认为；承担，担任，夺取</p><p><em>elementary school</em> 小学</p><p><em>fair</em> 园游会，游乐会；集市；商品展销会；白皙的，浅黄的，金色的</p><p><em>commission</em> 委员会；委任···军官；安排···做；（机器，军舰）在服役的，在使用中的</p><p><em>bonding</em> 人与人之间的关系，亲密关系的形成</p><p><em>immerse</em> 深陷于，沉浸于</p><p><em>constellation</em> 星座；群英荟萃，人才济济</p><p><em>emeritus</em> 荣誉退休的</p><p><em>literacy</em> 识字，读写能力；知识，能力</p><p><em>marinate</em> 腌，浸泡</p><p><em>devour</em> 狼吞虎咽，吞食；如饥似渴地阅读</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>现在生活中的诱惑太多，确实是很少能够静下心来阅读一本书了。</p><p>突然想起我最近阅读还是上个月的事情，我发现只有开始阅读自己喜欢的书时就会沉浸其中直到读完为止，但一旦停下来就很难再找到开始阅读的机会，至少我自己是这样的。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Videos to film. This business won’t run itself.</em></p><p>What that <strong>actually</strong> looked like was me slumped at my desk, wrapped in a blanket with a mug of tea, doing a bunch of pseudo work + watching random video essays. Which lasted for about 5 days, until I woke up on Thursday feeling back to normal and ready to take on the world.</p><p>But if I’d applied the Reitoff Principle <strong>from the beginning</strong> I’d probably have recovered in ~2 days, and had a much better time.</p><p>Moral of the story: give yourself a break on days when you know you won’t be productive.</p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Ali xx</p><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>film</em> 电影，拍摄</p><p><em>actively</em> 积极，活跃</p><p><em>recharge</em> 充电，补给</p><p><em>pump</em> 泵，水泵</p><p><em>bother</em> 打扰，费心，懒得，麻烦</p><p><em>snippet</em> 片段，代码片段</p><p><em>write-off</em>  报销，抹杀</p><p><em>backlog</em> 积压，待定，积累</p><p><em>guilt-free</em> 无负罪感</p><p><em>crucial</em> 重要，关键，决定性</p><p><em>Instead of</em> 替代，而不是</p><p><em>takeout</em> 输出，发泄，外卖</p><p><em>light</em> 光，轻型，浅</p><p><em>slump</em> 低迷，不景气，萧条，滑坡，经济衰退</p><p><em>pseudo</em> 假</p><p><em>moral</em> 道德，精神，寓意</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者在某天突然感觉到自己很颓废，什么都不想做，只想躺在床上。以往这种情况他都会选择休息放松自己一段时间后再重归工作，但此次他选择了继续工作，结果状态低迷，效率低下，虚度了5天时间，最后幡然醒悟。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>学有学样，玩有玩样。该学的时候认真学，该玩的时候放肆玩。不要学习时想着玩，导致学不进去；也不要玩时想着学，导致玩的不开心。最重要的是学会劳逸结合，这样效率才会最大化。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

So far rescuers have recovered more than 60 bodies from the school, the official Xinhua News Agency said. But there was little word on the rest of the nearly 900 teenagers who were believed to be trapped under their collapsed school building.</p><p>Some students managed to escape, while at least one was pulled out of the wreckage alive Tuesday morning. At least 1,000 students and teachers were killed or missing after another school collapsed in Mianyang city, about 100 miles northeast of the epicenter, Xinhua reported.</p><p>Other schools closer to the epicenter also toppled, although specifics were not available because the area was generally inaccessible.</p><p>Earthquake engineers say that constructing a building to resist a quake of magnitude 7 or 8 is possible, but is often considered cost prohibitive, adding 7 to 8 percent in costs.</p><p>“Earthquake resistance is really more workmanship, than material,” Amr Elnashai, director of the Mid-America Earthquake Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says.</p><p>Most seismologists interviewed say that China’s quake code is adequate, if not the most up-to-date. “It is well-defined and has all the right features,” says Mr. Elnashai.</p><p>Earthquake resistance, he notes, does not mean buildings don’t sustain damage; they do, but don’t collapse.</p><p>Schools, he says, are particularly vulnerable because they are often mid-sized buildings, smaller projects for contractors that are paid for the a government bureaucracies. Two recent earthquakes in Indonesia and in Kashmir also resulted in a disproportionate student deaths. “Often school buildings suffer quite a bit,” Elnashnai says.</p><p>China has “fairly rigorous building codes that have been in place. The problem is implementation of the codes,” says Andrew Smeall, an associate with the Asia Society’s US-China Center in New York.</p><p>Roger Musson, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, notes that China has good earthquake engineers, but “you can never tell what’s going to happen on the spot.”</p><p>In Turkey’s devastating 1999 earthquake, building codes were excellent, but “fly by night builders” had erected buildings using “extremely poor” materials, Mr. Musson says.</p><p>“You can buy the building inspector,” he says, but “you can’t buy off the earthquake.”</p><p>China has a history of massive earthquakes. About 200 of its cities with a population of over a million are located at risk of magnitude 7 earthquake.</p><p>“In this case, where the earthquake occurred, there are a magnitude 4 earthquakes every couple of months,” says Lupei Zhu, an associate professor of geophysics, at St. Louis University in Missouri, and a former employee of the China Earthquake Administration, which oversees public awareness and the collection of seismic data for the country.</p><p>Bill Murphy, an engineering geologist at the University of Leeds in England, notes that magnitude of the quake is only one measure. “It’s not so much the magnitude, but the amount of shaking,” he says. “Some of these aftershocks [in Sichuan] have been earthquakes in their own right. That might cause some additional buildings to collapse, especially those that have been weakened by the main earthquake.”</p><p>A civil engineer at the University of Western Australia in Perth told New Scientist magazine that the buildings in Sichuan weren’t built to withstand an earthquake as large as the one that hit.</p><p>“The seismic code for the area substantially underestimated the earthquake strength,” said Hong Hao. He said that China’s earthquake regulations class this province as equivalent to a 7 on the Mercalli intensity scale, which uses historical information to assess risk of damage from earthquakes. That means there’s a 10 percent risk of an earthquake occurring every 50 years of an intensity that would cause negligible damaged.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>原文地址：</p><p><a href="https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/three-minutes-a-day-to-change-your-life/">https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/three-minutes-a-day-to-change-your-life/</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="Three-Minutes-a-Day-to-Change-Your-Life"><a href="#Three-Minutes-a-Day-to-Change-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="Three Minutes a Day to Change Your Life"></a>Three Minutes a Day to Change Your Life</h1><hr><p>Hey friends,</p><p>This week the team and I flew out to Portugal for a mini team retreat, where we stayed at this huge 9-bedroom villa in Lisbon.</p><p>Most days were just spent chatting in the sun about work stuff, but we also found time to explore the city and eat dinner together every evening. It was a lot of of fun and good vibes.</p><p>One of the highlights of the week was when my CEO coach, <a href="https://www.ericpartaker.com/">Eric Partaker</a>, came to the villa to kick-off his bespoke coaching and mentoring program called the K2 Academy with the team. For context: Eric has advised fortune 50 CEOs, helped build Skype’s multi-billion dollar exit, and also wrote one of my favourite books from 2022 – <a href="https://www.ericpartaker.com/the-3-alarms">‘The Three Alarms’</a> (which I’ve talked about in <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/the-three-alarms/">a previous newsletter</a>). So it was a super valuable and helpful day.</p><p><em>Oh, btw, Eric’s also kindly offering everyone a free download of his book which you can check out here:</em> <a href="https://www.ericpartaker.com/the-3-alarms"><strong>download ‘The Three Alarms’</strong></a><em>.</em></p><p>Something that particularly stuck with me from the session and book was his idea that behaviour follows identity. Basically, if we want to change our behaviour and build healthy habits, the best thing we can do is to assume a new identity i.e. start behaving like the heroic version of ourself.</p><p>Importantly, we need to figure out what our new identity looks like in three key areas of our life – health, wealth, and happiness – as these are the 20% of things that can create 80% of the improvements to our life.</p><p>In practice, the exercise involves creating a table that looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://aliabdaal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/email-1024x179.webp"></p><p>So, for each of those three areas we write down an identity, some values, a goal, and a daily #1:</p><ol><li><strong>Identity</strong> – what is the inspiring identity you want to possess? E.g. ‘world fitness champion’ for health or maybe something like ‘David Goggins’ or ‘hawkeye’ if you want to attach the identity to a person &#x2F; character.</li><li><strong>Values</strong> – what 3 words guide the behaviour of that identity? E.g. a ‘world fitness champion’ would be strong, relentless, and disciplined.</li><li><strong>Goal</strong> – if a person with that identity set a goal for the next 3 months, what specific thing would that person achieve? E.g. a ‘world fitness champion’ would consistently hit the gym at least 4 times a week.</li><li><strong>Daily #1</strong> – what is one thing you will do <em>today</em> that will bring you closer to achieving that goal? E.g. going for a run, eating max 2000 calories, etc.</li></ol><p>For example, here’s what my table looks like:</p><p><img src="https://aliabdaal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/email-1-1024x659.webp"><br>This table, then, basically acts as a blueprint for how we should live our life.</p><p>So, if I’m working, the idea is that I’d adopt the identity of (young) Charles Xavier and fully embrace the values of being honest, inspiring, and sharing without fear. It’s a super simple exercise, but it’s really helped me to switch gears and get into the right frame of mind whenever I sit down to get stuff done.</p><p>It literally takes 2-3 minutes to fill in, but it’s a genuinely incredibly helpful exercise with asymmetrical upside. In fact, everyone on my team is going to commit to spending 180 seconds a day doing this for the next few months, so I’d honestly recommend everyone give it a go too.</p><p>If you want, feel free to tag me on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal">@AliAbdaal</a>) with your own completed tables – I’d love to see them !😜</p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Ali xx</p><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>Portugal 葡萄牙</p><p>retreat 撤退，静修期间</p><p>villa 别墅</p><p>vibes 气氛，氛围</p><p>highlight 亮点，强调</p><p>kick-off 启动</p><p>bespoke 定制</p><p>fortune 财富</p><p>for context 背景</p><p>stuck 坚持，粘，棍子</p><p>session 会议</p><p>relentless 无情，坚持不懈，冷酷无情</p><p>asymmetrical 非对称</p><p>upside 上行，好处，上部</p><p>commit to 承诺</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者和他的团队去葡萄牙静修期间，有个号称是CEO教练的人（Eric）前往其所在的别墅授课，作者对会议和Eric书中一些观点印象深刻，然后对此发表的一些看法以及给我们示范应该如何去实践</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>个人感觉就是对应我们常说的：</p><p>你想成为怎样的一个人，然后设定短期、中期、长期目标，同时为了达到这些目标，每天应花3分钟定好当天的计划，提升效率，早日圆梦。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

We wish her all the best of luck in her new home.”</p><p>Ya Ya reportedly left the Tennessee zoo at around 8.45am local time, and is expected to be on a flight at noon for Shanghai.</p><p>At the top of popular social media network Weibo’s news section is ‘#Welcome Yaya Home Together#’ - showing how people are eagerly awaiting the return of the panda to her homeland.</p><p>As concerns grew for the panda’s treatment, some Chinese-Americans voluntarily flew to Memphis to visit and “guard for Ya Ya”.</p><p>Now, posts are spreading across Weibo with instructions on how to add panda icons to usernames, asking people to “forward and guard Ya Ya”.</p><p>Many people took to social media to wish the panda “safe travels”, saying she will “be missed”.</p><p>Other posted messages saying they were “honoured to have grown up” with the panda, and expressed gratitude at having been to see her before she left.</p><p>However, there have been some more aggressive messages left by social media users. One said: “Stop faking your affection, you make me sick” in Chinese.</p><p>Another said: “Ya Ya [has] suffered such a hard time. Come back home - we’re all waiting for you.”</p><p>One user took to Weibo to say: “The pain that has lingered in the heart of Chinese people for more than two months is finally relieved.</p><p>“How many days and nights, it looked at the sky and missed the clouds and moon in its hometown. How many seasons it has tasted bamboo and missed the flowers and grass of its hometown.”</p><p>Others said: “Ya Ya, welcome home, the dark days are over”.</p><p>People across China have been watching Ya Ya closely after questions were raised over the treatment of her and male mate Le Le who died in February.</p><p>The zoo has previously denied allegations of mistreatment, accusing activists of spreading misinformation.</p><p>The zoo said Ya Ya has a chronic skin and fur condition, which causes her fur to “occasionally” look “thin and patchy.”</p><p>Critics have been posting in the zoo’s comment section calling the zoo “nasty” saying children “will see animals being mistreated” if they visit in regards to allegations of mistreatment of the giant pandas.</p><p>Other users have responded to the latest news on Twitter saying: “Your family are always hungry as yaya? How dare your statement state that yaya [sic] has become like family?”</p><p>A video shared by animal advocacy groups In Defense of Animals and Panda Voices last year showed the pair pacing in circles. Groups said the animals seemed to have lost fur and weight, calling on them to be “returned to China before it’s too late.”</p><p>Anger was renewed in February after 25-year-old Le Le died.</p><p>Giant pandas live anywhere from 25 to 30 years in captivity, though many questioned whether the animals were being neglected by US zookeepers when relations between the US and China deteriorated due to diplomatic disputes and trade barriers.</p><p>People began pushing for Ya Ya’s return to China earlier following Le Le’s death - with people putting up slogans and pictures on advertisement locations across China.</p><p>Chinese experts flew to the US following Le Le’s death, and along with US counterparts, came to an initial conclusion he had died of heart disease.</p><p>Ya Ya was given a check up where it was determined she had a good appetite and stable weight, and was healthy apart from the skin issue.</p><p>Before she left, 22-year-old giant panda Ya Ya even had a farewell party at Memphis Zoo on Saturday, April 22, ahead of her return to China.</p><p>It’s thought around 500 people attended the event, which featured cultural Chinese performances.</p><p>Ya Ya and Le Le arrived in Memphis on loan in 2003 as part of what’s been called ‘panda diplomacy’ tactics used by China to help foster relationships with other countries.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>embark on</em> 开始，着手做</p><p><em>bound</em> 跳跃，跳动；前往&#x2F;开往···的；受束缚的，受约束的，在法律或道德上有义务的</p><p><em>veterinarian</em> 兽医</p><p><em>sorely</em> 极其，非常</p><p><em>icon</em> 图标；象征物，偶像</p><p><em>aggressive</em> 好斗的，挑衅的，侵略的；来势汹汹的，声势浩大的</p><p><em>linger</em> 继续存留，逗留，徘徊</p><p><em>allegation</em> 指控</p><p><em>mistreatment</em> 虐待</p><p><em>misinformation</em> 错误的消息，假消息</p><p><em>chronic</em> 慢性的，长期的</p><p><em>patchy</em> 零散的，散落的，分布不均衡的；时好时坏的</p><p><em>nasty</em> 令人厌恶的，极差的；不友好的，严重的，危险的；下流的，无礼的</p><p><em>advocacy</em> 拥护，主张，提倡</p><p><em>pace</em> 来回踱步，走来走去</p><p><em>fur</em> 皮毛</p><p><em>renew</em> 延长···期限；更新，更换；重新开始</p><p><em>captivity</em> 监禁，关押，圈养</p><p><em>deteriorate</em> 恶化</p><p><em>diplomatic</em> 外交的</p><p><em>slogan</em> 口号，广告语</p><p><em>counterpart</em>  职位相当的人，作用相当的事物</p><p><em>farewell</em> 告别</p><p><em>tactic</em> 策略，手法</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>阔别20年，欢迎回家。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

We bounced ideas around, and everyone had their say on the long-term business strategy.</p><p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/dHG4aSRazwrs3LA9HPR1C/pWfZ9qScrUJbasWX1CLteq/email"></p><p>Taking time off from ‘business as usual’ reminded me of this great point (roughly paraphrased from Steven Covey’s <a href="https://geni.us/highlyeffectivepeople"><em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a><em>):When it comes to Things, effectiveness and efficiency are usually broadly similar. But when it comes to People, effectiveness often</em> <em><strong>looks</strong></em> <em>like inefficiency.</em></p><p>As you probably know, I focus a lot on efficiency.

If a 1-hour meeting took 20 minutes I’d say ‘great, that was super efficient. Let’s get back to work.’</p><p>But what I realised during our planning session is that people need time and space to speak their mind. With two whole days set aside, everyone loosened up and a whole bunch of minor (and occasionally major) issues came to light that we’d have missed under normal circumstances.</p><p>Potentially mission-critical stuff.</p><p>And if you want to run a happy, profitable, <strong>effective</strong> business (rather than one that just <strong>looks</strong> efficient) you have to make time for that to happen.</p><p>In short: human beings aren’t machines. If you want to be effective in your collaborations and relationships, you can’t focus exclusively on ‘getting things done ASAP’.

The surprising answer"></a><strong>Is it better to spend or save? The surprising answer</strong></h1><hr><p>We all have our own money personality that represents our beliefs and behaviours around our cashola, and part of that is our identity as a spender or a saver.</p><p>Like many things, when it comes to being a spender or a saver, there’s often said to be a spectrum or a scale on which we all sit. Despite this, research has shown that generally we can all self-categorise as one or the other.</p><p>So which are you?</p><p>I’ll start. Hi, I’m Emma and I’m a natural spender.</p><p>I’ve always been a spender. It’s just the way I am. I was also the kid that would eat all my allocated lollies in one go and get jealous of the ones who saved theirs.</p><p>My natural spender tendencies meant I spent most of my life wishing I was a saver. Just like I envied the kids that saved their Skittles, I envied those that seemed to have this miraculous ability to hold onto their money.</p><p>“Life as a saver must be so great”, I’d think to myself. Never wondering where all your money went. Never feeling that wrath of getting to payday and having to dip into yet another attempt at saving.</p><p>But is being a saver actually better? Recently, I’ve come to question exactly that.</p><p>Traits of a natural saver</p><p>Research in the financial psychology field has established that our life experiences create a set of financial beliefs that inform the way we think and feel about money. Commonalities in beliefs and their correlating behaviours have led experts to develop four different ‘scripts’ or narratives for individuals to identify with – one of which is known as money vigilance.</p><p>Money vigilance is most strongly associated with the traits of a natural saver. Things like frugality, fears of not having enough, need for security, and a greater desire to retain money than to spend it.</p><p>On paper, a money vigilance narrative often makes for “better” financial outcomes. Natural savers tend to have more money in the bank, less trouble holding onto their income, and even an ability to disconnect with the idea of spending on enjoyment.</p><p>Your bank balance isn’t the only marker of financial wellbeing</p><p>While natural savers might have a higher savings rate (the percentage of their income sent to savings) or more money in the bank, natural spenders may actually be better positioned to achieve financial wellbeing.</p><p>That’s because a savvy saver’s juicy savings balance can actually be a sign of fear and anxiety around money. When we have fear around money running out or obsess over saving, our overall levels of wellbeing can decrease. These types of savers often find it hard to enjoy life as a result of their obsessive saving behaviours.</p><p>Saving all your money sounds great in theory – but what’s the point if you never use it for anything?</p><p>Savers carry a lower risk tolerance</p><p>Natural savers may also experience a lower risk tolerance than that of a spender. Being extremely fearful of risk can hold savers back from wealth creation behaviours like investing, or even things like mortgage debt.</p><p>Resistance around investing in assets that have the potential to outperform inflation can actually leave a savvy saver worse off in the long run.</p><p>While everyone has a varying risk appetite, spenders may be more able to see the value of buying things like shares or property, because they’re used to parting with their money in exchange for a benefit.</p><p>Are spenders better able to optimise their behaviour?</p><p>Now don’t get me wrong. Me and my fellow spendy Susans aren’t immune from limitations of our natural tendency to splurge.</p><p>The writing is on the wall. Overspending and overconsumption is common in the modern world of e-commerce and buy-now-pay-later. Every dollar spent is one less dollar that can be saved.</p><p>But as a reformed overspender myself, I have a theory.

It’s all in your mind"></a><strong>Why does time fly … or not? It’s all in your mind</strong></h1><hr><p>How many times have you felt the time fly on a busy day or felt it drag when you least wanted it to? Why does time seem to go faster or slower depending on what else is going on?</p><p>Most of us will be familiar with the experience of time passing excruciatingly slowly when we’re waiting for something to happen.</p><p>Studies have shown this is especially the case when we are looking forward to something, said cognitive neuroscientist Muireann Irish from the University of Sydney.</p><p>Think about a child who repeatedly asks, “Are we there yet?” or, “How long before I can open my Christmas presents?”</p><p>“If we’re waiting for something to happen … time can dilate and actually feel it has been a lot longer in duration,” Dr Irish said.</p><p>And time can appear to drag even more slowly if you’re the impulsive type, who gets restless or even angry when you don’t get what you want immediately.</p><p>In a study by German psychologist Marc Wittmann, people forced to sit in a room without doing anything for seven-and-a-half minutes felt the time passed differently, depending on who they were. Some said the duration was just two-and-a-half minutes, while for the most impulsive it felt like 20.</p><p>So it’s not just external factors, but who we are that influences our perception of time. But how does that work?</p><p>Fast v slow: How does our brain sense time?</p><p>There’s no real consensus on where and how in the brain time is processed, said Dr Wittman, who is from the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg.</p><p>But, he said evidence suggest our brain’s motor regions are important at timescales relevant to activities like talking, playing music, driving or playing sport — a matter of a few seconds at most.</p><p>When it comes to durations longer than five seconds, Dr Wittmann’s experiments indicate our judgments are not that accurate.</p><p>At this “fuzzy” level of sensing time, a different part of the brain is involved.</p><p>In another set of experiments carried out by Dr Wittman, people in an fMRI scanner were asked to judge the duration of intervals lasting up to 18 seconds.</p><p>He found more accurate judgements of duration were made by those who had more activity in a part of the brain called the insular cortex.</p><p>This is responsible for integrating signals from all over the body, and enables us to “sense our self” — and the passing of time, Dr Wittmann said.</p><p>“Through the feeling of our body over time we sense duration,” he said.</p><p>When we’re not doing anything, we’re less distracted and are more sensitive to how we feel and to the passing of time.</p><p>“In boredom, because we are overly sensing our own bodily feelings, time expands a lot.”</p><p>While time sometimes can drag — it can also fly, and when you least want it to. Like when you’re having fun.</p><p>This is because we only have a finite amount of attention to give the world, Dr Irish said.</p><p>So, if we are focusing on something fun then we pay less attention to the passing of time, and it appears to move more quickly. The same applies when you’re busy.</p><p>“If we are multitasking and we are extremely busy, then we can have this time contraction affect where the day seems to go by extremely quickly and we can’t figure out where all those hours went,” Dr Irish said.</p><p>Sometimes running on “autopilot” can make time seem to speed up so much we get stressed, Dr Wittmann said.</p><p>He said mindfulness was one way to cope with this.</p><p>“Leave the room, go out of the office building, even if it is just five minutes … you then feel yourself again … and suddenly time passes very slowly again.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>drag</em> 拖沓，过得很慢</p><p><em>excruciatingly</em> 极其痛苦地，难以忍受地</p><p><em>neuroscientist</em> 神经学家</p><p><em>dilate</em> 扩大，扩张，展开</p><p><em>impulsive</em> 冲动的</p><p><em>restless</em> 坐立不安的，焦躁的，不耐烦的</p><p><em>perception</em> 认识，观念，看法；知觉，感知</p><p><em>consensus</em> 共识，一致的意见</p><p><em>timescale</em> 一段时间，起止时间，时段</p><p><em>fuzzy</em> 模糊的，杂乱的，有干扰的</p><p><em>insular</em> 思想狭隘的，保守的</p><p><em>cortex</em> 皮层，皮质</p><p><em>integrate</em> 结合，使合并</p><p><em>multitask</em> 同时做多件事</p><p><em>contraction</em> 收缩，缩小，缩短</p><p><em>mindfulness</em>  正念认知</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>等待中的时间永远觉得是最漫长的。就像面试一样，在候考室等待真是煎熬，但一旦进入考场后，又会觉得时间飞快，感觉还没开始就结束了😄</p><p>那其实对应学习应该也可以这样，尤其是学习些比较难的知识时，找个安静的环境让自己进入心流状态，这样就不会觉得时间漫长，反而还会觉得时间不够用。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Kishida was evacuated unharmed from the site, and later resumed his schedule of speeches for the day. One police officer was slightly injured, Kyodo said.</p><p>The event has chilling echoes of the fatal shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a stump speech ahead of last year’s upper house elections. Five by-elections are set to be held next weekend, including in the constituency left vacant by Abe’s death.</p><p>The incident also calls into question security arrangements for the G-7 summit to be held in May in Kishida’s home town of Hiroshima, as well as related ministerial meetings all over the country.</p><p>“We are now holding elections, which are the most important thing for our country,” Kishida said in a speech broadcast by NHK following the incident. “With your help, I want to push through with this important election to the end.”</p><p>Support for the premier has been buoyed in recent weeks by his visit to Ukraine, as well as progress toward reconciliation in a long-running feud with South Korea. That’s renewed speculation that he might call a general election in the coming months if the by-elections and summit both go smoothly.</p><p>Showing fortitude in the face of the latest incident could bolster Kishida and his party in the by-elections, an analyst said.</p><p>“Continuing with his campaign speeches will be well received by voters,” said Shigenobu Tamura, a political analyst who previously worked for Kishida’s main ruling Liberal Democratic Party. “They will appreciate him continuing with his duties regardless of what might happen to him.”</p><p>The premier was touring a fishing port in support of an LDP candidate and was about to address a crowd when the incident occurred. Video shown by broadcaster TBS on its website showed a young man with a backpack being tackled and held down by a group of people, followed by the sound of an explosion and screams, while smoke spread across the area.</p><p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters that police were looking into the motive and background of the suspected perpetrator. He added that he had instructed them to be thorough in protecting VIPs ahead of the summit.</p><p>Security had already been a high priority for the G-7 summit set for May 19-21 following the shock of last year’s assassination. G-7 ministers are also having meetings on the northern island of Hokkaido and in the resort town of Karuizawa this weekend.</p><p>A representative of the Wakayama police department declined to comment to Bloomberg News.</p><p>Ruling and opposition politicians condemned the incident. Hiroshi Moriyama, the election chair of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said on NHK that it was deplorable for such a thing to happen during elections, the foundation of democracy. “It’s an unforgivable act of violence,” he said.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>resume</em> （中断后）继续，重新开始；恢复，重新回到，重返某个位置</p><p><em>campaign</em> 从事活动，开展运动，发起运动</p><p><em>allegedly</em> 据称，据说</p><p><em>suspicion</em> 嫌疑，怀疑</p><p><em>prefecture</em> （法意日等国的）地方行政区，省，县，辖区</p><p><em>evacuate</em> 疏散，使撤离</p><p><em>chilling</em> 令人恐惧的，令人不寒而栗的</p><p><em>echo</em> 重复，附和；回声，回响；表示十分相似的东西，仿效</p><p><em>stump speech</em> 巡回政治演讲，竞选演讲</p><p><em>by-election</em> 补选</p><p><em>constituency</em> 选区的选民</p><p><em>vacant</em> 空缺的</p><p><em>call into question</em> 引起对···的怀疑</p><p><em>primer</em> 首相，总理</p><p><em>buoy</em> 支持，使更成功；鼓励，鼓舞</p><p><em>reconciliation</em> 和解，和好</p><p><em>feud</em> 世仇，长期争斗</p><p><em>renew</em> 更新，更换，延长···期限；重新开始</p><p><em>speculation</em> 推测，猜测；投机买卖</p><p><em>fortitude</em> 勇敢，坚韧，刚毅</p><p><em>bolster</em> 加固，提高，改善</p><p><em>tackle</em> 阻截，铲球</p><p><em>hold sb&#x2F;sth down</em>  把···按住，使无法动弹</p><p><em>perpetrator</em> 犯罪者，作恶者</p><p><em>thorough</em> 彻底的，完全的；仔细的</p><p><em>assassination</em> 刺杀，暗杀</p><p><em>resort</em> 旅游胜地，度假胜地</p><p><em>condemn</em> 谴责，指责</p><p><em>deplorable</em> 极其恶劣的，非常糟糕的</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p> 🍉吃瓜，不予置评，毕竟是小日子过的不错的事</p></blockquote>]]></content>

The disease still killed someone every three minutes, he said.</p><p>“Yesterday, the emergency committee met for the 15th time and recommended to me that I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern,” said Tedros. “I’ve accepted that advice.”</p><p>He added: “It’s therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency. However, that does not mean Covid-19 is over as a global health threat. Last week, Covid-19 claimed a life every three minutes – and that’s just the deaths we know about.”</p><p>The global health emergency status helped focus international attention on the Covid threat, as well as bolstering collaboration on vaccines and treatments. Lifting it is a sign of the progress the world has made in these areas, but Covid-19 is here to stay, health officials believe, even if it no longer represents an emergency.</p><p>The WHO does not declare the beginning or end of pandemics, although it did start using the term for Covid in March 2020. Tedros said the decision to downgrade the alert status did not mean the danger was over, cautioning that the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed.</p><p>“The worst thing any country could do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,” he said.</p><p>Covid has officially claimed more than 6.9 million lives, and affected the health of more than 765 million others, according to the WHO. It said the true figures were likely to be much higher. Covid deaths globally have plunged by 95% since January, but the disease still killed 16,000 people worldwide last month alone.</p><p>Despite the lingering danger, the pandemic has faded from mind in many if not most countries. This week, Tedros said testing and tracing efforts had “declined significantly around the world, making it more difficult to track known variants and detect new ones”.</p><p>He has also warned of the ongoing impact of long Covid, which provokes a long line of often severe and debilitating symptoms that can drag on for months or years. The condition is estimated to affect one in 10 people who contract Covid, suggesting hundreds of millions of people could need longer-term care, he has said.</p><p>Long Covid was devastating lives and livelihoods and wreaking havoc on health systems and economies, Tedros told the Guardian last year as he urged countries to launch immediate and sustained efforts to tackle the “very serious” crisis.</p><p>“While the pandemic has changed dramatically due to the introduction of many lifesaving tools, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, the impact of long Covid for all countries is very serious and needs immediate and sustained action equivalent to its scale,” he said.</p><p>He added: “Early in the pandemic, it was important for overwhelmed health systems to focus all of their life saving efforts on Covid-19 patients presenting with acute infection. However, it is critical for governments to invest long-term in their health system and workers and make a plan now for dealing with long Covid.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>constitute</em> 组成，构成，被视作，被算作</p><p><em>panel</em> 专家小组，讨论小组</p><p><em>director general</em> 大型机构的总裁，主席，局长</p><p><em>downgrade</em> 降级，降职，贬低，轻视</p><p><em>stark</em> 明显的，鲜明的；严酷的，赤裸裸的</p><p><em>persistent</em> 持续的，存留的，顽强存在的；坚持不懈的，执意的</p><p><em>claim</em> 获得，赢得；声称，断言，主张；夺走生命</p><p><em>bolster</em> 加固，提高，改善，加强</p><p><em>lift</em> 举起，提起，吊起；解除，撤销；偷盗，剽窃</p><p><em>caution</em> 小心，谨慎；告诫，提醒</p><p><em>reinstate</em> 使重返岗位，使恢复原职；把···放回原处；使恢复原状</p><p><em>dismantle</em> 拆除，逐步废除</p><p><em>plunge</em> 暴跌</p><p><em>lingering</em> 持续的，长时间的，拖延的，缠绵的，迟迟不去的</p><p><em>variant</em> 变体，变种，变形</p><p><em>ongoing</em> 持续存在的，不断发展的，进行中的，持续进行的</p><p><em>debilitating</em> 使虚弱的，使软弱的</p><p><em>devastate</em> 严重破坏，彻底摧毁</p><p><em>wreak havoc</em> 肆虐，造成严重破坏</p><p><em>sustained</em> 持续的，持久的，坚定的，坚持不懈的</p><p><em>overwhelmed</em> 被压倒的，被淹没的，受宠若惊的，不知所措的；彻底征服，击败</p><p><em>acute</em> 严峻的；（疾病）急性的</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p>“三年了，你知道我这三年怎么过的吗！“</p><p>三年疫情改变了很多，生活中的方方面面基本都受到了不同程度的影响，还记得那时很多人的愿望就是活下来 😷，三年时间如此的快…</p><p>其实按照世卫的说法，只是警戒的等级降低了，但新冠的威胁并未解除，所以大家还是要做好防护。</p>]]></content>

It’s based on René Girard’s theory of ‘mimetic desire’, the idea that we often want things just because <strong>other</strong> people have those things.</p><p>See lots of other people using AirPods? Suddenly you want a pair. Friends all getting married? Marriage seems more appealing.</p><p>Same goes for all sorts of situations: colleagues going on adventure holidays, acquaintances learning to code, the neighbours buying a fancy BBQ…</p><p>See enough people doing something, and <strong>you’ll</strong> feel like doing it as well.</p><p>Immediate acquaintances have a particularly big influence, because they’re your closest point of comparison. You don’t get jealous of The Rock for having a big mansion or rippling biceps – but if it’s your best friend making millions and getting shredded, you might feel differently.</p><p>This got me thinking about my wariness of business conferences (much like the one I’m currently at)</p><p>When I’m around entrepreneurs in the $10 million+ range, it makes me “want” that too. In that moment, as I’m standing in a conference room talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck2yqXMofoc&t=3982s">Steven Bartlett</a> or <a href="https://neilpatel.com/">Neil Patel</a>, being a super-rich businessperson with a huge business and huge team seems really cool.</p><p>So I leave the conference fired up with lots of business ideas. But after a few days that feeling fades, and I realise it was probably <strong>mimetic desire.</strong></p><p>So, how do we figure out what we really want?</p><p>Luke uses the concept of ‘thick’ versus ‘thin’ desires. Thick desires are things you want on a deep level. Stuff that makes you feel happy or fulfilled once you have it or are doing it. Thin desires are usually mimetic – stuff you only <strong>think</strong> you want because you see that other people have it.</p><p>He recommends asking: “What’s a time in my life when I took action, and it made me feel genuinely fulfilled?” This brings out the ‘thick’ desires, things that we genuinely value.</p><p>For me, what immediately comes to mind is the Cambridge University hospital pantomime that us medical students took part in. There was so much camaraderie, and performing on stage every night with a bunch of friends made me feel that ‘yes, life is good’.</p><p>Other things that meet that description for me:</p><ul><li>Working with a small team to create videos (that I’m proud of)</li><li>Teaching people</li><li>Reading (and hopefully writing) amazing books</li><li>Spending time with friends + family</li></ul><p>Try thinking about your own thick &#x2F; thin desires – you might surprise yourself.</p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Ali xx</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>mastermind 策划，主谋<br>pristine 原始，纯粹<br>sprawl 蔓延，扩张<br>metropolis 大都市<br>mimetic 模拟<br>desire 渴望，欲望<br>comparison 比较，对照<br>mansion 豪宅，别墅<br>ripple 波动<br>biceps 二头肌<br>shred 撕碎<br>wariness 谨慎，戒心<br>fire up 开火<br>thick 浓厚，厚重<br>versus 与<br>stuff 东西，物质<br>genuinely 真心，真正<br>Cambridge University 剑桥大学</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者去迈阿密参加一个商业会议的途中，重读了一本关于欲望相关的书籍，然后引发自己的一些思考，并引用书中的内容给出一些建议，让我们直面内心真正的欲望，去实现自己的价值。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>我觉得文中这句话：</p><blockquote><p>You don’t get jealous of The Rock for having a big mansion or rippling biceps – but if it’s your best friend making millions and getting shredded, you might feel differently.</p></blockquote><p>与最近网上看到的一个梗所表达的意思挺符合的：“又怕兄弟苦，又怕兄弟开路虎”😂</p><p>回到正题，感觉就是想提醒我们找到自己真正的目标，不要随波逐流吧。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>原文地址：<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULOT_XxKZnebJONdZ-g_CA">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULOT_XxKZnebJONdZ-g_CA</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="How-to-Talk-To-Your-Barber-and-Get-the-Haircut-You-Really-Want"><a href="#How-to-Talk-To-Your-Barber-and-Get-the-Haircut-You-Really-Want" class="headerlink" title="How to Talk To Your Barber and Get the Haircut You Really Want"></a><strong>How to Talk To Your Barber and Get the Haircut You Really Want</strong></h1><hr><p>Guys: we have a communication problem. It’s not with our families (though, yes, that’s very real). It’s not with our coworkers (we’ll get to Roy in receivables another day). It’s not even with our partners. We have a problem talking to arguably one of the most important people in your life: your barber. Yet, according to nearly every barber I’ve ever spoken to, most men lack the know-how to articulate what they want their hair to look like when they’re in the chair. Or more accurately, a majority of guys don’t have the language to even begin talking to the pros about what to do with their heads.</p><p>It’s a good thing barbers are trained to interpret our babble. Any cutter worth his salt should be able to decode what you want. They might even be able to decipher what you want when you’re not even aware of that is. But when it comes to your hair, a barber’s number one priority is making you happy, so they’re going to take everything you say with a grain of salt until they can decipher what it is you’re actually looking for. It’s easy to cling to clipper settings (“I’m a one up to a three”), or technical terms you don’t entirely understand (“I want a fade”). But those won’t quite get you across the finish line.</p><p>So what do you do? We spoke to Matty Conrad, veteran barber and founder of Victory hair products, about how best to navigate the situation. Whether you’re walking into a new barber shop for the first time or you just want to let your current barber know, in uncertain terms, what you want, we’ve got you covered.</p><ol><li>Don’t Speak With Words</li></ol><p>You know Zayn Malik’s hair? Try to describe it. Tough, right? So when you sit down at the barber, pull out your phone. Have a few pictures ready before you walk in, even if it’s not the full haircut you like. Say you like this guy’s bangs, or this guy’s taper, or this guy’s edges, or all of the above—your barber can bring all those elements together to create the look you’re after. Hallelujah: all that time spent on Instagram was actually building to a purpose..</p><ol start="2"><li>Know Your Hair</li></ol><p>Everyone’s hair is different—not just in color. But in texture, thickness, and moisture. And knowing what kind of hair you have will help you understand what kind of cut will work best, and save you a lot of headaches down the line. Your barber will be able to tell you if the haircut you’re asking for is a good fit—and also give you some real talk if you’re thinking crazy. (Don’t know what kind of hair you have? You guessed it: ask your barber.)</p><ol start="3"><li>Use The Right Terms</li></ol><p>And by that, we mean no terms. Avoid using words you’ve heard from previous barbers or read on the internet: you probably don’t actually know what “texture” means, no matter how many times you’ve asked for it. Conrad suggests talking about how you want the haircut to feel, not look. For instance, if you want movement on top, say that—instead of, like, “layers,” which you probably don’t want. “You have nothing to prove to [your barber],” Conrad says. So quit trying.</p><ol start="4"><li>And Please Don’t Ask For A Fade (Unless You Want A Fade)</li></ol><p>A quick PSA: stop asking for a fade. Not because you shouldn’t want one (it’s a classic haircut that will always look great), but because what you think is a fade and what actually is a fade are not the same thing. A classic fade is when your hair is cut all the way down to the skin at your hairline (also professionally known as a skin fade). You probably don’t want that. If you want a gradient effect—but, y’know, without the skin showing—ask for a taper.</p><ol start="5"><li>Forget The Number System</li></ol><p>You might think that adhering to the number settings on an electric clipper means you can get the exact same haircut, no matter the barber. Sorry to burst your bubble, but it’s impossible to get the same cut from different barbers. The clipper setting numbers (one, two, three, etc.) are good references for the haircut you got last time, but they’re not a good reference for someone you’ve never been to before. Different barbers have different clippers, different eyes and different interpretations. Hair is not a math equation.</p><ol start="6"><li>Know The Difference Between A Cut And A Style</li></ol><p>Think about what kind of hair you want. Now think about what you’re willing to do in order to get that hair. Will you blow dry every morning? Will you use multiple products? Will you use…any products? All of these things are crucial information for a barber, because if you’re not willing to put in the work, you’re not going to like the haircut. Remember this: a haircut is a component of a hairstyle, but not the whole thing.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>receivables</em> 应收款项或收款部门</p><p><em>arguably</em> 大概，可能，按理</p><p><em>articulate</em> 清楚表达，清晰发音</p><p><em>interpret</em> 说明，诠释；把···理解为，领会；演绎；翻译，口译</p><p><em>babble</em> 乱哄哄的声音</p><p><em>worth your salt</em> 称职的，胜任的</p><p><em>decode</em> 解码，解读；正确理解（外语单词或短语）</p><p><em>decipher</em> 解释，破译，辨认，解释</p><p><em>take sth with a gain of salt</em> 对···半信半疑</p><p><em>cling to sth</em> 坚持，保持，死死抱住（信念或希望）</p><p><em>clipper</em> 剪刀</p><p><em>veteran</em> 老手，在某方面经验丰富的人；老兵，退伍军人</p><p><em>bangs</em> 刘海儿</p><p><em>taper</em> 灯芯，烛芯；在理发术语中指头发长度从一侧逐渐变短到另一侧</p><p><em>hallelujah</em> 哈利路亚</p><p><em>texture</em> 质地，质感；特色，韵味，格调</p><p><em>thickness</em> 厚度</p><p><em>moisture</em> 潮气，湿气，水分</p><p><em>layer</em> 层，涂层</p><p><em>PSA</em> public service announcement的缩写，公益广告，公共服务声明</p><p><em>gradient</em> 坡度，斜率，倾斜度；变化率。梯度变化曲线；渐变</p><p><em>burst someone’s bubble</em> 打破某人幻想</p><p><em>blow dry</em> 吹干头发</p><p><em>component</em> 组成部分</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p>剪头发就是赌博，剪完后好不好看全看运气😄</p>]]></content>

TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. That puts it at the center of the growing strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing, with bilateral relations at their lowest point in decades.</p><p>During a House hearing that ran for more than five hours on Thursday, Mr. Chew—a Singaporean national—was subject to withering attacks on TikTok as he tried to make his case that the company would earn lawmakers’ trust. </p><p>In a rare bipartisan display, Democrats and Republicans repeatedly questioned him over similar issues, at times not allowing him to finish sentences. TikTok later said that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing. </p><p>Apple didn’t immediately respond when asked why it was important that Mr. Cook attended the Chinese-government sponsored conference at a time when U.S.-China tensions are on the rise. In 2017, Mr. Cook said it was important not to be a bystander in China if you want to achieve change. This is his fifth time attending the annual forum.</p><p>Mr. Cook is among the dozens of American and other foreign executives attending, or set to attend, the three-day conference that started Saturday.</p><p>For U.S. business leaders, the risk of potential fallout from being seen hobnobbing in Beijing is high, given how senior American government officials have held off from visiting China.</p><p>In some of the sessions Saturday, the geopolitical tensions loomed as the elephant in the room.</p><p>Qualcomm Inc. CEO Cristiano Amon focused his talk on the digital transformation and 5G, and their potential to boost businesses and productivity in society as a whole.</p><p>In a session on rebuilding supply chains, multinational businesses were represented by top executives from Australian and German companies.</p><p>In other sessions, senior advisers to the Chinese government largely stuck to topics deemed by Beijing as essential to the country’s economic future, including carbon neutrality, technology innovation and healthcare.</p><p>Still, some ventured further, pointing to high inflation and the banking crisis as two risks to the global economy emanating from the U.S. At the same time, they touted Beijing’s ability to manage its debt and economic headwinds.</p><p>“Some developed countries sharply tightened their monetary policies, which brought spillover effects such as bank bankruptcy, foreign debt difficulties, and financial market turmoil,” said Han Wenxiu, a deputy head of the General Office of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>take the stage</em> 登台表演</p><p><em>upbeat</em> 积极向上的，乐观的，快乐的</p><p><em>counterpart</em> 相反的，对立的，相应的</p><p><em>pandemic</em> 流行病，大规模流行的，广泛蔓延的</p><p><em>guesthouse</em> 客房（大型住宅留给客人用的小屋子），小客栈</p><p><em>privilege</em> 特许的，享有特权的，受特别优待的</p><p><em>hub</em> 中心，枢纽，核心</p><p><em>symbiotic</em> 共生的</p><p><em>profile</em> 简介，概况；关注度</p><p><em>rivalry</em> 竞争，较量，竞赛</p><p><em>bilateral</em> 双边的，双方的</p><p><em>withering</em> （目光，话语等）令人难堪的，尖刻的；严厉的，极为挑剔的</p><p><em>bipartisan</em> 为两党派所支持的，包括两个党派的</p><p><em>grandstanding</em> 哗众取宠，炫耀卖弄</p><p><em>dominate</em> 控制，主导，占支配地位的</p><p><em>bystander</em> 旁观者，看热闹的人</p><p><em>fallout</em> 不良影响，恶果</p><p><em>hobnob</em> 亲近，过从甚密</p><p><em>loom</em> 隐约可见，赫然耸现；（不希望&#x2F;不愉快的事情）阴森地逼近</p><p><em>the elephant in the room</em> （人们不愿提及的）棘手问题</p><p><em>multinational</em> 跨国公司的</p><p><em>deem</em> 认为，相信</p><p><em>neutrality</em> 中立，中立状态</p><p><em>venture</em> （尤指有风险的）企业，商业，投机活动，经营项目；敢于去，冒险去</p><p><em>emanate</em> 表现，显示；来自，发源于，产生于</p><p><em>spillover</em> 溢出；（非预期的）影响</p><p><em>turmoil</em> 动乱，混乱</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>不可否认苹果在科技创新领域是领头羊，值得各大厂商学习，但近几年国产在智能设备上的创新也不算少，结果却有不少的人在冷嘲热讽，反之是苹果经常炒冷饭，很多人都能无脑狂吹，实在想不懂。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Baidu shares tumble as it unveils Ernie Bot</h1><h1 id="From-Reuters"><a href="#From-Reuters" class="headerlink" title="From: Reuters"></a>From: Reuters</h1><hr><p>Chinese search engine giant Baidu on Thursday unveiled its much-anticipated artificial intelligence-powered chatbot known as Ernie Bot, giving the world a glimpse of what could be China’s strongest rival to U.S. research lab OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p><p>The popularity of ChatGPT, backed by Microsoft, has triggered a frenzied rush among Chinese tech giants and startups alike to develop a rival. Baidu jumped to the forefront of the race after saying early last month it was close to completing a chatbot using its AI-driven deep learning model, Ernie - short for “Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration”.</p><p>The Ernie Bot introduction, in a presentation at Baidu headquarters in Beijing, comes two days after Alphabet Inc’s Google unveiled a flurry of AI tools for its email, collaboration and cloud software. Microsoft is expected to make a similar announcement to Google later on Thursday.</p><p>“For sure we cannot say that it’s perfect,” said Baidu CEO Robin Li, presenting Ernie Bot. “So why are we unveiling it today? Because the market demands it.”</p><p>But the limited presentation of Ernie Bot, restricted to brief, pre-recorded videos, failed to match market hopes and Baidu’s Hong Kong-listed shares in the firm tumbled as much as 10% before clawing back some ground.</p><p>During the presentation, Li showed five videos of Ernie Bot answering questions on popular Chinese science fiction novel “The Three Body Problem”, carrying out mathematical calculations, understanding Chinese dialects and generating a video and image with text prompts.</p><p>“Today’s announcement is a natural continuation of the hard work we have put in over the past many years,” he said at the event, which was also livestreamed across nine platforms, including Twitter, Youtube and Weibo.</p><p>Starting Thursday, Ernie Bot will be open to an initial group of users with invitation codes, and companies can apply to embed the bot into their products via Baidu’s cloud platform.</p><p>Baidu has touted its many years of heavy R&amp;D investment in artificial intelligence and deep learning as one reason it is best placed to lead the race to develop a Chinese answer to ChatGPT. Baidu’s research and development expenses in 2022 were 21.4 billion yuan ($3.1 billion), accounting for 22% of revenue.</p><p>Baidu plans to use Ernie Bot to revolutionise its search engine, by far the most dominant in China, as well as use it to increase efficiency in cloud, smart cars and household appliances, among other mainstream businesses.</p><p>Earlier this week, OpenAI on Tuesday said it is beginning to release a powerful artificial intelligence model known as GPT-4, describing it as “multimodel”, meaning images as well as text prompts can spur it to generate content.</p><p>Li nodded to GPT-4 during his speech, saying that its coming showed the threshold for this sort of technology was very high, and that it surprised him with its ability to summarise information.</p><p>But he also cautioned against seeing this through the lens of geopolitics. “Ernie Bot is not a tool of confrontation between China and the United States,” he said.</p><p>To date, 650 companies have said they will join the Ernie ecosystem, he added. Chinese state media outlets and a Shaolin temple were among the first sign-ups to become Ernie Bot partners.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>share</em> 分享，股票，股价</p><p><em>tumble</em>  滚动，跌倒，下跌</p><p><em>unveil</em> 揭露，揭幕，公布</p><p><em>Reuters</em> 路透社</p><p><em>glimpse</em> 瞥见，短暂的感受</p><p><em>rival</em> 竞争对手，敌手；可与之媲美，比得上</p><p><em>trigger</em>  触发器，扳机</p><p><em>frenzied</em> 疯狂的，暴乱的</p><p><em>integration</em> 结合，整合</p><p><em>flurry</em> 一阵忙乱（关注，激动）；阵雨&#x2F;雪</p><p><em>match market hope</em> 符合市场预期</p><p><em>list</em> 动词：上市</p><p><em>claw sth back</em> 费力夺回，设法捞回</p><p><em>prompt</em> 提示，促使</p><p><em>continuation</em> 持续，延续</p><p><em>livestream</em> 互联网直播，线上直播</p><p><em>tout</em> 吹嘘，吹捧，标榜</p><p><em>sb’s answer to sb&#x2F;sth</em> 与…相当，…的对应物</p><p><em>revolutionise</em> 在某方面引起突破性变革</p><p><em>dominant</em> 首要的，占支配地位的，显著的</p><p><em>appliance</em> 家电</p><p><em>spur</em> 刺激，激励</p><p><em>threshold</em> 界限，门槛，临界点，下限</p><p><em>caution</em> 小心，谨慎；告诫，提醒</p><p><em>geopolitics</em> 地缘政治</p><p><em>confrontation</em> 对峙，对抗，交锋，对立</p><p><em>outlet</em> 直销店，商店 </p><p><em>media&#x2F;news outlet</em> 媒体&#x2F;新闻机构</p><p><em>To date</em> 迄今为止</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>2023年3月16日，百度为了迎合市场需求，发布了并不完美的文心一言机器人，结果与市场预期不符，导致股价大跌。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>自2023年开年以来，chatgpt大火，引发了一阵科技狂潮。国内的科技巨头为了搭上这班人工智能列车，纷纷宣布入局，百度就是其中之一。当初宣传时万众期待，结果发布会只是展示了几个预录的视频，并没有与文心一言进行实时互动，由此受到质疑与嘲笑是肯定的了。</p><p>不过个人认为，还是需要给予一定的耐心，毕竟训练和发展还需要一定时间，想霎时间就达到老美发布的GPT4水平是不可能的，至少现在还是勉强坐上了这趟AI列车，不至于落后太多。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

In 2019, Dolce &amp; Gabbana saw China sales slow after it faced a backlash for an advertising campaign that was decried as racist by celebrities and on social media. The Italian luxury brand asked for forgiveness and said there was a “cultural misunderstanding”.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>skid</em> 打滑</p><p><em>melee</em> 混乱，混乱的人群</p><p><em>berate</em> 严责，训斥</p><p><em>discriminate</em> 歧视</p><p><em>booth</em> 小房间</p><p><em>favour</em> 优惠，偏袒，特别照顾</p><p><em>giveaway</em> 赠品</p><p><em>sb&#x2F;sth in question</em> 讨论中的···；正被谈论的···</p><p><em>repost</em> 转发</p><p><em>controversy</em> 争议</p><p><em>rival</em> 竞争对手</p><p><em>aggressively</em> 好斗地，富于攻击地，挑衅地；进取地，有侵略性地</p><p><em>stand</em> 货摊，售货亭</p><p><em>tub</em> 一桶，小杯</p><p><em>attendee</em> 出席者，参加者</p><p><em>serving</em> 供一人食用的一份；一客；目前任职的，现役的</p><p><em>sensitivity</em> 敏感，谨慎对待</p><p><em>talk sth up</em> 热烈地谈论，宣扬</p><p><em>curve</em> 曲线，弧线，转弯</p><p><em>monitor</em> 监视，检查，跟踪调查</p><p><em>perceive</em> 感知，察觉，意识到；认为，看待，视为</p><p><em>slight</em> 少量的；轻视，冷落，怠慢</p><p><em>territorial</em> 领土的，领地的，土地的</p><p><em>snowball</em> 不断扩大，滚雪球般迅速增大</p><p><em>boycott</em> 抵制</p><p><em>backlash</em> 强烈抵制，集体反对</p><p><em>decry</em> 公开谴责，强烈批评</p><p><em>racist</em> 种族主义的，种族主义者</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>崇洋媚外，有些人跪久了就站不起来了。</p><p>题外话：这就是我不买宝马的原因 🐶</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>原文地址：<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QIUVa428xVIEhiGrQhLeMw">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QIUVa428xVIEhiGrQhLeMw</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="How-to-Give-Sincere-Compliments"><a href="#How-to-Give-Sincere-Compliments" class="headerlink" title="How to Give Sincere Compliments"></a><strong>How to Give Sincere Compliments</strong></h1><hr><p>A kind, genuine, thoughtful compliment is like a form of magic—it has the power to turn someone’s day around in an instant and make them feel proud, happy, and appreciated. And while there’s nothing wrong with telling someone you like their shirt (as long as, you know, you actually do—we’re not talking about Mean Girls Regina George-style “Oh my God I love your bracelet, where did you get it?!” compliments), giving a compliment is really an opportunity to go deeper and strengthen your bond with the person.</p><p>“Compliments can be a useful tool to nurture and enhance relationships,” says psychotherapist Lindsay Liben, LCSW. “Ultimately it contributes to deeper, more intimate connection.”</p><p>And beyond the benefits to relationships, doling out compliments can immediately make you as the giver happier as well. Liben points to research showing that giving gratitude-based compliments, in particular, correlates with greater levels of optimism, satisfaction and happiness. As relationship expert and coach Rachel DeAlto puts it, “Compliments create positive energy! And like gifts, giving them can benefit the giver as well as the recipient.”</p><p>Here’s how to build a sincere, thoughtful compliment, that will strengthen your relationships, boost happiness and gratitude, and definitely bring a smile to someone’s face.</p><p><strong>Link your compliment to something you genuinely feel.</strong></p><p>To give a compliment that really resonates, Liben suggests a three-step process, which starts by identifying an action or quality that you truly respect or appreciate. “The compliment should be authentic,” she says, and connected to values that you personally hold dear or that you know are important to that person.</p><p><strong>Then, think about why you appreciate that quality.</strong></p><p>The next step is to figure out the reason this quality resonates so strongly with you. So to put the first two steps together, for example, if you’re thinking about complimenting a friend about her vacation-planning skills leading up to your girls trip, consider why you appreciate the related actions—did she make the trip fun and stress-free for everyone else, for example? Then, connect the first two steps to deliver the compliment, being as specific as possible. So in the case of the getaway, it might be something like, “You’re so fantastic at picking incredible places to eat! I so appreciate that you’re in control.”</p><p><strong>Be authentic and specific, not hyperbolic.</strong></p><p>Liben also recommends keeping in mind the “KISS” method for giving compliments: That is, “Keep It Sincere and Specific.”</p><p>“Hyperbole or gratuitous praise can cheapen the gesture, making it feel empty and disingenuous. An honest compliment, even if it’s a small one, carries more weight,” she explains.</p><p>So, for example, telling your friend that the party she threw was “Literally the best night ever,” might come off as less meaningful than something along the lines of, “I love how you had icebreaker games ready to go so we could all get to know each other as soon as we got there! Hosting seems to come so naturally to you and I really appreciate you always introducing me to new people.”</p><p><strong>Done right, even seemingly superficial compliments can make someone’s day.</strong></p><p>“Never underestimate the power of a ‘your blouse is beautiful’ or ‘your haircut is fantastic,’ to brighten someone’s day,” says DeAlto. “Yet we can always dig deeper and find an attribute, personality trait or accomplishment to compliment as well.”</p><p><strong>…but use adjectives.</strong></p><p>Liben agrees that “Skin-deep compliments may sometimes feel shallow, but in the right context, they can be empowering and appreciated.” She recommends making a simple compliment resonate even more by actually connecting it to a more emotional thought, like instead of saying, “I love your dress!” adding something like, “Your sunny yellow dress is beautiful and seeing it brightened my morning!”</p><p><strong>Compliment your favorite traits in your romantic partner.</strong></p><p>The formula of specific trait plus emotional connection works for complimenting romantic partners on a deeper level as well, and can even help your relationship. “Identifying and celebrating what you adore about your partner can improve your relationship by increasing mindfulness,” says Liben, adding that as a bonus, “the effects of complimenting a romantic partner can also contribute to greater conflict resolution and better communication.”</p><p><strong>Use compliments as a tool in the workplace.</strong></p><p>Regularly complimenting your co-workers or employees can actually boost their performance: Liben points to a link between expressing well-deserved performance-related recognition and improving professional output. To do this as effectively as possible, “the compliment should be genuine and deserved,” she says, as well as performance-specific.</p><p>“Use context clues to help you formulate an appropriate sentiment. For example, after a coworker gives a powerful presentation, compliment her delivery rather than her outfit,” she says.</p><p><strong>Don’t be afraid to compliment a stranger!</strong></p><p>Whether it’s a person on the train or a musician whose performance rocked the house, well-founded (read: not creepy!) compliments are generally appreciated. But for people who are shy, it can be easier said than done. (“What if she thinks I’m weird?” or some version of that may be running through your head.)</p><p>“Start by taking the emotional thermometer of the situation by making eye contact with the receiver,” advises Liben. “Then proceed with a smile. Be direct and speak in an audible volume that conveys confidence.”</p><p>Besides likely bringing a smile to the other person’s face, Liben adds that “If complimenting a stranger is outside your comfort zone, it can be a real dopamine rush.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>genuine</em> 真正的，名副其实的；真诚的，真心的，诚实的</p><p><em>compliment</em> 赞美，称赞，赞扬，钦佩，致敬</p><p><em>turn sth around</em> 好转，使扭转，使有起色</p><p><em>bracelet</em> 手镯，手链</p><p><em>nurture</em> 促进，扶助，培养</p><p><em>psychotherapist</em> 心理治疗师</p><p><em>intimate</em> 亲密的</p><p><em>dole sth out</em> 发放。发给（事物，钱等），分发钱等，施舍</p><p><em>optimism</em> 乐观，乐观主义</p><p><em>resonate</em> 使产生联想，引起共鸣</p><p><em>authentic</em> 可靠的，真正的</p><p><em>getaway</em> 短假</p><p><em>hyperbolic</em> 夸张的</p><p><em>gratuitous</em> 不必要的，无谓的</p><p><em>disingenuous</em> 虚伪的</p><p><em>literally</em> 确实地，名副其实地；逐字翻译地；真正地，确实；只是，仅仅</p><p><em>come off</em> 取得预期的效果，成功</p><p><em>line</em> 做法，方法，看法，立场；台词；话语，言语</p><p><em>make sb’s day</em> 令某人开心快乐</p><p><em>blouse</em>  女式衬衫</p><p><em>attribute</em> 属性，特性，特质</p><p><em>skin-deep</em> 肤浅的，表面的</p><p><em>empowering</em> 使有自主感的，使感到有自立能力的，增强自信的</p><p><em>formulate</em> 制定，规划，构想</p><p><em>sentiment</em> 意见，观点，看法，情绪</p><p><em>well-founded</em> 理由充分的</p><p><em>creepy</em> 怪异的，令人毛骨悚然的</p><p><em>thermometer</em> 温度计，体温计</p><p><em>audible</em> 听得见的</p><p><em>dopamine</em> 多巴胺</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>“我是一个特别固执的人，我从来不会在意别人跟我说什么，让我去做。如果你也可以像我一样，那我觉得这件事情，泰裤辣！”</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>原文地址：</p><p><a href="https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/how-to-get-lucky/">How to Get Lucky - Ali Abdaal</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="How-to-Get-Lucky"><a href="#How-to-Get-Lucky" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Lucky"></a>How to Get Lucky</h1><hr><p>Hey friends,</p><p>Firstly, thank you for all your kind responses to my last email (+ offers of mini therapy sessions). I have a book deadline crunch right now, so please forgive my slow responses. But I’ll try to get back to everyone.</p><p>Anyway – I’ve been thinking a lot recently about randomness + serendipity.</p><p>See, I was invited to give a talk at the <a href="https://1billionsummit.com/">1 Billion Followers Summit</a> in Dubai this week. It ended up being super fun, and I hung out with a bunch of other creators (other speakers at the conference, and also attendees). But in all honesty, with all the travel I’ve been doing recently, I was feeling a bit burned out at the prospect of a 48-hour trip to Dubai of which 18 hours would be spent on an aeroplane 😂</p><p>But when taking the decision to go, the two questions I asked myself were:</p><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is this something I’m likely to regret?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. It’s just 1–2 days, I can work on the plane, it won’t really disrupt my life.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Will this increase the serendipity in my life?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Who knows what life-changing thing could happen, or who I’ll meet. There’s a much higher chance of something interesting happening on this trip than if I stay at home.</p><p>And this time, optimising for serendipity paid off big time.</p><p>I met the business + finance creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Erika2">Erika Kullberg</a>. And we had a fantastic conversation about business, team management, content strategy. It’s rare to find someone who has a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erikankullberg/">bigger audience</a> than me, while also having an identical business model. I absorbed so much incredible information.</p><p>And one conversation made the whole trip immediately “worth it” even outside the enjoyment of presenting and meeting people. I even told Erika that it was one of the highest ROI conversations I’ve ever had.</p><p>I’ve been banging this drum for a while but it’s worth saying again: never underestimate <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/finding-inspiration-in-dubai/">the power</a> of <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/the-value-of-saying-yes/">randomness</a> and <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/window-openers-vs-door-knockers-202120/">serendipity</a>.</p><p>Only very rarely will you regret going to a networking event, meeting people or just <strong>doing something</strong> rather than sitting around at home.</p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Ali xx</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>therapy</em>  治疗，疗法</p><p><em>crunch</em> 紧缩，危机，紧缺</p><p><em>serendipity</em> 偶然性</p><p><em>Dubai</em> 迪拜</p><p><em>hung out with</em> 出去玩</p><p><em>burn out</em> 疲惫</p><p><em>prospect</em> 前景，展望，前瞻</p><p><em>decision</em> 决定，决策</p><p><em>identical</em> 同样的，相同的</p><p><em>bang</em> 爆炸，砰，邦，一声巨响</p><p><em>underestimate</em> 低估，轻视</p><p><em>networking event</em> 社交活动</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者前往迪拜参加会议途中，遇到金融界大拿，并与之展开了一场很有价值的谈话。这也使他领略到了偶然性和随机性的魅力，呼吁大家多点社交，少点宅在家中。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>越努力，越幸运。坐在家中什么都不做是不会有幸运女神眷顾的，多点出门走走，遇到有趣事情的机会也会增加，也能增长见识，因此古人所说的“读万卷书，行万里路”还是有一定道理的。</p><p>不过对社恐来说，多去参加社交活动可能略有难度😂。无论怎样，趁年轻，多尝试。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

However, from a scientific perspective, adulthood is an unsolved mystery.</p><p>Even neuroscientists don’t know when adolescence ends and adulthood begins in the brain – after all, our brains are constantly changing, according to a new opinion paper published in the journal Neuron on Wednesday.</p><p>“There is no agreed-on benchmark that, when reached, would allow a neuroscientist to say ‘Aha! This brain is fully developed,’ ” said Leah Somerville, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard University, who wrote the paper.</p><p>“However, it is safe to say that by almost any metric, the brain is continuing to develop actively well past the age of 18,” she said. “The reason I think it’s important to discuss this issue is because policies impacting youth have begun to pay more and more attention to the concept of neurodevelopmental maturity, so neuroscientists have begun to get engaged in these complicated discussions,” such as debates about when to charge a child with an adult crime or when to permit aging out of the foster care system.</p><p>So, why can’t the brain reveal whether you’re an adult or not? Different parts of your brain mature at different times, Somerville said.</p><p>“Brain development occurs in waves, with different brain regions having their major developmental events at different times,” she said. “So, the measurements that index brain maturation will give you different answers depending on what measure you’re focusing on and where in the brain you’re looking.”</p><p>In other words, since there is no definitive way to measure brain maturity, there is no definitive age in which your brain signals that you are an adult.</p><p>Your brain consists of two types of tissue, gray matter and white matter. In your first decade of life, the gray matter grows and expands rapidly as many new synapses, or connections between nerves, are being made. The gray matter grows as you learn and are exposed to new experiences as a child.</p><p>Then, as your body prepares for puberty, your brain starts to prune back some of that gray matter and amp up its production of white matter, which allows different parts of the brain to share information better and faster, said Dr. Jess Shatkin, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Child Study Center at NYU Langone Medical Center, who was not involved in the new paper.</p><p>“The brain volume, the total volume, doesn’t really change, but we lose about 1% of gray matter starting around 13 and we gain about 1% of white matter at the same time, and that trade off keeps going,” Shatkin said.</p><p>“There are big changes (in the brain) until the early 20s, and there may be pretty significant changes still until the early 30s,” he said. “We’re still learning. Whereas, once upon a time, we imagined adolescence to end at 18, now we don’t really know when this process of development ends. … Twenty-five, 26, 28, 30, 32? We don’t know.”</p><p>Shatkin added that this maturation process of the brain tends to appear in female brains earlier than male brains.</p><p>“There’s been some neurological data showing that girls’ brains may begin to prune earlier,” he said. “This certainly goes along with what we typically observe clinically as well.”</p><p>Overall, most neuroscientists agree that “there’s no magic age at which the brain reaches adulthood,” said Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a research professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting to see a paper like this, and have thought of writing one myself,” he said. “I’ve done a lot of research on how people define adulthood, and people vary, but in general it’s not an age, it’s defined by qualities such as accepting responsibility for yourself and making independent decisions.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>neuroscientist</em> 神经学家</p><p><em>adolescence</em> 青春期</p><p><em>benchmark</em> 基准</p><p><em>associate professor</em> 副教授</p><p><em>metric</em> 公制的，米制的；度量标准。衡量指标</p><p><em>maturity</em> 发育成熟，长成；心智成熟，成熟阶段，完善的状态；到期，开始有回报</p><p><em>wave</em> 波浪</p><p><em>definitive</em> 最终的，决定性的，不可更改的；最佳的，最完整可靠的</p><p><em>synapse</em> 突触</p><p><em>puberty</em> 青春期</p><p><em>prune</em> 修剪（树枝），删除，删节</p><p><em>amp sth up</em> 加大，加强</p><p><em>psychiatrist</em> 精神病医生</p><p><em>volume</em> 总数，总量，容积，体积，容量；音量；卷，册</p><p><em>trade-off</em> 权衡，协调，平衡，交换</p><p><em>clinically</em> 临床诊断地；冷漠地，无动于衷地，无感情地</p><p><em>vary</em> 各不相同</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><p>🧠真是一个复杂的身体结构。年龄只是法律上成年的一个界限，判断一个人是否真的心智成熟应该如文中所说，能否为自己的行为负责和独立地做出决定。</p>]]></content>

Prolific Beats Perfect</strong></p><p>The point of creating content (from a business perspective) is so that your audience develops a connection with you.</p><p>People increasingly want to buy things from <strong>other people</strong>, not faceless corporations. And the way to inspire people and deepen that relationship with them is through being prolific. Create things weekly, daily, finish projects quickly.</p><p>The more you create, the higher your chances of making that <strong>one video</strong> or blog post that strikes a chord.</p><p>In other words, quantity beats quality.</p><p>Take the Beatles, for example. They wrote on average one song every ~8 days for 12 years, and often <strong>multiple</strong> albums in a year. They didn’t spend years agonising over every little detail – but their songs are still legendary. If they’d been perfectionists, they probably wouldn’t have gotten as far as they did.</p><p>The point is – don’t don’t set your quality bar too high. Just get out there and create.</p><p>⏳ <strong>2. Content is Time Travel</strong></p><p>This is really true.</p><p>For example, Dan wrote his book <a href="https://geni.us/xCzg">Key Person of Influence</a> 12 years ago. And all these years later, Chris Do read it, vibed with the ideas, and invited Dan onto his podcast.</p><p>So in a way, Dan-from-12-years-ago communicated with modern-day Chris in a time-travelly kind of way. And it let to new opportunities, with the two guys chatting on a podcast, becoming friends, and potentially working together on a business.</p><p>So remember – with every piece of content you put out there (especially on a platform with longevity, like YouTube or a blog), you’re leaving a breadcrumb trail that will lead interesting people to you in the future.</p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Ali xx</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>prolific</em> 高产</p><p><em>perspective</em> 视野，角度，观点，前景，展望</p><p><em>strikes</em> 打击，袭击</p><p><em>chord</em> 琴弦</p><p><em>quantity</em> 数量</p><p><em>quality</em> 质量</p><p><em>Beatles</em> 披头士乐队</p><p><em>multiple</em> 多重，多个，多次，倍数</p><p><em>agonising</em> 苦恼</p><p><em>perfectionist</em> 完美主义者</p><p><em>longevity</em> 长寿，寿命</p><p><em>breadcrumb</em> 面包屑</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者听播客有感，给我们分享的两个经验：</p><ol><li>多产胜于完美。告诉我们初创时期应注重数量，以数量取胜，忽略部分细节</li><li>告诉我们写下&#x2F;拍下（记录）的内容也许将来会为我们带来机会，就像一场跨时空的相遇</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>个人认为作者分享的两个经验具有局限性，其更加适合自媒体创作的相关人员，而非作者认为适合所有人，尤其是以数量取胜的策略。</p><p>在自媒体初创时期，想获得关注度确需不断创作获取观众的眼熟，若想维持一批稳定的观众并得到认可，后期也必定需要改善质量，不然无法长久。若做的是其他相关行业，例如零售，餐饮等，质量无法保证，数量根本无从可谈。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

      <title>呼吁暂停训练比GPT4更强大的AI系统</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>原文地址：</p><p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yXK7lgnWuQkM1d9209RtPg">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yXK7lgnWuQkM1d9209RtPg</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="Pause-Giant-AI-Experiments-An-Open-Letter"><a href="#Pause-Giant-AI-Experiments-An-Open-Letter" class="headerlink" title="Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter"></a><strong>Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter</strong></h1><hr><p>AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity, as shown by extensive research and acknowledged by top AI labs. As stated in the widely-endorsed Asilomar AI Principles, Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources. Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.</p><p>Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system’s potential effects. OpenAI’s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that “At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.” We agree. That point is now.</p><p>Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.</p><p>AI labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts. These protocols should ensure that systems adhering to them are safe beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not mean a pause on AI development in general, merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities.</p><p>AI research and development should be refocused on making today’s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal.</p><p>In parallel, AI developers must work with policymakers to dramatically accelerate development of robust AI governance systems. These should at a minimum include: new and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI; oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems and large pools of computational capability; provenance and watermarking systems to help distinguish real from synthetic and to track model leaks; a robust auditing and certification ecosystem; liability for AI-caused harm; robust public funding for technical AI safety research; and well-resourced institutions for coping with the dramatic economic and political disruptions (especially to democracy) that AI will cause.</p><p>Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI. Having succeeded in creating powerful AI systems, we can now enjoy an “AI summer” in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all, and give society a chance to adapt. Society has hit pause on other technologies with potentially catastrophic effects on society. We can do so here. Let’s enjoy a long AI summer, not rush unprepared into a fall.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>pose</em> 姿势；造成，引起；提出问题，质询</p><p><em>endorse</em> 赞同，支持，认可；宣传，代言；（在支票背面）签名，背书（指的是政治领域为某人发声，支持某人或某事）</p><p><em>commensurate</em> 相当的，相称的</p><p><em>be locked in sth</em> 被···困住，受到···阻碍；陷入···停滞不前</p><p><em>propaganda</em> 宣传，鼓吹</p><p><em>fulfilling</em> 令人愉快满足的</p><p><em>outnumber</em> 在数量上超过，比···多</p><p><em>outsmart</em> 在智力上超过，胜过；智胜</p><p><em>obsolete</em> 过时的，废弃的</p><p><em>delegate</em> 委派，委托，授权</p><p><em>magnitude</em> 巨大，重大，重要性；震级</p><p><em>verifiable</em> 可证实的，可证明的</p><p><em>enact</em> 通过，实施，指定；表演；发生</p><p><em>step in</em> 插手，介入</p><p><em>institute</em> 建立，制定；研究所，学院</p><p><em>constitute</em> 组成，构成，被视作</p><p><em>moratorium</em> 暂停，中止</p><p><em>protocol</em> 规程，协议；礼仪，外交礼节；条约，公约，议定书</p><p><em>rigorously</em> 严密地，严谨地，缜密地；严格地，严厉地</p><p><em>audit</em> 审计，审查</p><p><em>oversee</em> 监督，监察</p><p><em>emergent</em> 新兴的，发展初期的</p><p><em>state-of-the-art</em> 先进的</p><p><em>interpretable</em> 可解释的，可阐明的</p><p><em>robust</em> 强劲的，富有活力的，强健的，强壮的</p><p><em>oversight</em> 监管，监督；失察，疏忽</p><p><em>provenance</em> 起源，出处</p><p><em>watermark</em> 水印</p><p><em>synthetic</em> 人造的，合成的</p><p><em>catastrophic</em> 灾难性的，糟糕的</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>AI发展太快，监管机制尚未完善，暂停一段时间或是好事，没人能知道电影中AI觉醒的事件是否真会发生，若真到那时再考虑安全问题恐怕就来不及了吧。（<del>细思极恐</del>）</p></blockquote>]]></content>

      <title>原来哭真的有用</title>

In King Henry VI, Shakespeare wrote, “to weep is to make less the depth of grief”, and the American writer Lemony Snicket said “unless you have been very, very lucky, you know that a good, long session of weeping can often make you feel better, even if your circumstances have not changed one bit”.</p><p>Charles Darwin, on the other hand, thought that the production of tears (the act of crying notwithstanding) was merely a useless side effect of the way that the muscles around the eye worked. For him, those muscles had to contract from time to time so that they didn’t overflow with blood; the expulsion of tears was simply an unintended consequence of that evolved physiological process. (He did acknowledge that crying could help young infants attract the attention of their parents, though.)</p><p>We now know that crying – at least, the sort that adults do – is a complex physiological response to some kind of emotional stimulus. The most prominent feature is of course the shedding of tears, but it also includes changes in facial expressions and breathing patterns. “Sobbing,” for example, refers to the rapid inhalation and exhalation that so often accompanies crying.</p><p>From a scientific perspective, that means crying is different from the production of tears in response to a chemical irritant, like when you accidentally rub your eyes after eating spicy foods. Even the tears themselves are different. In 1981, Minnesota psychiatrist William H Frey II discovered that tears brought on by sad movies had more protein in them than those that flowed in response to some freshly chopped onions.</p><p>As anyone who has attended a side-splitting comedy act or listened to a groom read wedding vows to his bride, emotional tears aren’t limited to feelings of melancholy. But while all of us are familiar with the feelings that are associated with crying, whether for joy or sorrow, there’s not much that’s known about why we do it as adults – but there are plenty of ideas.</p><p>One idea is that adult crying isn’t actually all that different from the sort that babies do, at least when it comes to its social nature. In other words, perhaps weeping is a literal cry for attention, a means of soliciting support and help from our friends when we need it the most. It’s a way of communicating our inner emotional state at a time when we may not be able to fully articulate it.</p><p>While this may explain some forms of crying, many researchers have found that adults often cry when they’re completely alone. Another possibility that is that crying might serve as a means of “secondary appraisal,” helping people to realise just how upset they are, a way of helping them understand their own feelings – it’s a provocative idea, with at least some evidence to support it, in some cases.</p><p>And then there’s the notion of catharsis: crying provides for relief from emotionally stressful situations. The idea is consistent not only with the words of Shakespeare, but with the Roman poet Ovid, who wrote: “It is a relief to weep; grief is satisfied and carried off by tears.” The Greek philosopher Aristotle also wrote that crying “cleanses the mind”. In a 1986 study of popular US magazines and newspapers, one psychologist found that 94% of articles about crying suggested that it helped to relieve psychological tension.</p><p>Indeed, a 2008 study of nearly 4,300 young adults from 30 countries found that most reported improvements in both their mental and physical wellbeing after a bout of crying, but not all. Some reported no change after a crying session, and some even said that they felt worse afterwards.</p><p>The difference seems to lie in the social context: if a person felt embarrassed about crying in public, for example, they might feel less resolved than if they cried alone or with a single close friend. The study also found that when people tried to suppress or hide their crying, they also wound up feeling less relief afterwards.</p><p>So the notion of having “a good cry” is not without merit, but it seems to necessitate the right kind of social support to be effective. Which means, in the end, that adults might just cry for much the same reason as human infants: to seek help from their friends and family.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>stark</em> (对比)鲜明的，明显的；严酷的，赤裸裸的，真实而无法回避的</p><p><em>weep</em> 哭泣，流泪</p><p><em>circumstance</em> 情况，条件，情形；客观环境，命运</p><p><em>notwithstanding</em> 尽管</p><p><em>contract</em> 合同，契约；收缩</p><p><em>overflow</em> 溢出，泛滥；装不下，挤得太满；人满为患，挤满</p><p><em>expulsion</em> 排出，喷出；驱逐，开除，赶走</p><p><em>evolve</em> 演变，进化</p><p><em>physiological</em> 生理学的</p><p><em>prominent</em> 重要的，著名的，杰出的；突出的，显眼的</p><p><em>shed</em> 棚子，小屋；使脱落，使掉落；去除，摆脱</p><p><em>sob</em> 呜咽，抽泣</p><p><em>inhalation</em> 吸入，吸气</p><p><em>exhalation</em> 呼气，呼出</p><p><em>irritant</em> 刺激物，令人烦恼的事物，造成麻烦的事物</p><p><em>rub</em> 摩擦，擦，搓</p><p><em>psychiatrist</em> 精神病学家</p><p><em>side-splitting</em> 令人捧腹的，极为有趣的</p><p><em>groom</em> 培养，培训；新郎</p><p><em>bride</em> 新娘</p><p><em>melancholy</em> 忧愁，忧伤</p><p><em>literal</em> 字面的，根本的</p><p><em>solicit</em> 招徕（嫖客）；拉客</p><p><em>articulate</em> 明确表达</p><p><em>provocative</em> 激进的，使人生气的，挑衅的，煽动的；引发思考的，启发性的</p><p><em>catharsis</em> 情感的宣泄，精神净化</p><p><em>cleanse</em> 清洗，使清洁</p><p><em>bout</em> 一场，一阵，一段，（疾病）发作</p><p><em>resolve</em> 化解，决心，解决</p><p><em>wind sth up</em> 使结束，关闭，使停业</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>放声大哭对情绪释放很有用，成年人的哭泣大部分和婴儿一样，都是想获得朋友或家人的关注和帮助</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>虽说男儿有泪不轻弹，只因未到伤心处。看来”男人哭吧哭吧不是罪”唱的还是挺正确的。</p><p>遇到伤心事别憋着，找个地方或朋友放声大哭，当别人说你哭有什么用的时候，你就把这文章甩他脸上，告诉他，哭(╥╯^╰╥)是真的有用的。😂</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Four Key Questions"></a><strong>Will This Be the ‘Indian Century’? Four Key Questions</strong></h1><hr><p>It is a turning point the world has not seen in centuries, and is unlikely to see again for centuries more.</p><p>India is on the cusp of passing China in population, according to the latest U.N. estimates. At 1.428 billion people, India has already edged past China’s mainland, the data show.</p><p>With China’s population declining, the margin between the two countries will only grow as India becomes the most populous country in history. What had long been the world’s largest democracy is now, simply, the world’s largest everything.</p><p><strong>Can India take advantage of its size?</strong></p><p>India’s growth curve is the envy of aging countries like China, but the demographic future differs by region of the country.</p><p>There was a time when India and China wanted to suppress the rate of population growth, by reducing the number of births. That era has long receded.</p><p>The gentle slope of the demographic curve propelling India into first place looks enviable to the many developed nations that are rapidly aging. Indians are living longer, and the number of babies being born each year has barely budged.</p><p>In some of India’s regions, the population is still growing too fast for their economies, producing many more able-bodied young people than there are jobs to occupy them. In other parts, however – especially the better-developed south, where women have more education and family planning programs have proved successful – the population has already peaked. There, young families rarely produce more than two children.</p><p>The physical needs of nearly a billion and a half people are imposing a terrible strain on India’s environment. But as the country lifts itself from deepest poverty, it is no longer subject to the famines of old. Instead, its future as far and away the world’s biggest work force is leading some to hope for an “Indian century” in the making.</p><p><strong>Does India stand to reap a “demographic dividend”?</strong></p><p>Having a fast-expanding young work force could be a big opportunity — or a disaster.</p><p>India is a country primed to work. More than two-thirds of all Indians are between the ages of 15 and 59. The country’s ratio of children and retirees to working-age adults is remarkably low.</p><p>But this opportunity comes with huge challenges. That “demographic dividend” could instead become something like a disaster. In some recent years, India has squeaked past China to claim the title of fastest-growing major economy. But it has never expanded fast enough to produce sufficient formal employment for everyone. The country needs about nine million new jobs every year just to keep pace; the annual shortfall helps relegate many to India’s old standby, agricultural work.</p><p>Most people in India lack the means to be “unemployed” – in the work force but without a job. Underemployment is the more discreet danger. Wages have been stagnant for eight years, according to an analysis by Jean Drèze, an economist at Delhi University. Economic growth without an equivalent increase in jobs makes India’s massively unequal society even more so, raising the potential for unrest.</p><p><strong>Can India get more women into the work force?</strong></p><p>Women work outside the home at lower rates in India than almost any other country, a huge roadblock for economic expansion.</p><p>India has one of the world’s lowest rates of formal employment for women: about one in five. China’s is almost double that rate, higher than the United States’ and the world average. An economy cannot meet its potential when it draws on the contributions of so few women.</p><p>Also worrisome, the rate has actually declined in India even as most of the country’s economic conditions have improved. The explanation favored by economists is that the jobs most women take are so poorly paid that as soon as a family can do without the extra income, wives stop working outside the home.</p><p>That does not mean women in India do not work hard. They are a visible presence in the 41 percent of society that is still in agriculture, and they carry nearly all of the household burdens. But so long as these women remain outside the formal work force, they cannot enter its most productive categories, in industry and services. Improved access to family planning, better education, efforts to change societal attitudes and measures to ensure women’s safety could help more women take on formal work.</p><p><strong>Can India chart its own path to prosperity?</strong></p><p>India’s economic story will not be a repetition of China’s — which could offer advantages.</p><p>Western countries are now rushing to embrace India as an alternative to China. But the obstacles that have kept India from following the same program over the past 30 years remain in place: ineffective governance, insufficient infrastructure, and scanty spending on primary education and health.</p><p>A “Make in India” program championed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, now in its eighth year, has been slow to take off.</p><p>India’s economic story, however it turns out, will not be a repetition of China’s. There are many ways in which India can rise, especially with industrial manufacturing no longer occupying the central role in the world economy that it once did.</p><p>Services now make up a huge and exciting part of the Indian economy, augmented by a low-cost digital infrastructure that India developed on its own. Other glimmers are also emerging: Chip makers are looking to India as a high-end substitute for China; online services are allowing millions of young Indians to work abroad without leaving home; and even life in India’s villages is becoming more urbanized by the year.</p><p>The only certainty about the new biggest country in the world is that it will be unlike any that came before it.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>on the cusp</em> 分界线</p><p><em>edge</em> 缓慢发展，徐徐移动；优势，优越之处</p><p><em>margin</em> 差数，差额</p><p><em>populous</em> 人口稠密的</p><p><em>demographic</em> 人口的，人口学的；族舞</p><p><em>recede</em> 逐渐远离，变得模糊，逐渐淡漠</p><p><em>slope</em> 山坡</p><p><em>budge</em> 使改变主意；使轻微移动</p><p><em>able-bodied</em> 体格健全的，强壮的</p><p><em>impose</em> 推行，强制实行；强加于；勉强，打扰，麻烦</p><p><em>strain</em> 压力，重负；品种；旋律，曲调</p><p><em>famine</em> 饥荒</p><p><em>squeak</em> 勉强通过，侥幸成功</p><p><em>relegate</em> 使贬职，使降级</p><p><em>discreet</em> 谨慎的，小心的</p><p><em>stagnant</em> 停滞的</p><p><em>roadblock</em> 路障</p><p><em>chart</em> 计划行动步骤，制定行动计划；上榜；图表，示意图</p><p><em>prosperity</em> 成功，繁荣，昌盛</p><p><em>scanty</em> 少量的，不足的，缺乏的</p><p><em>champion</em> 支持，声援，捍卫</p><p><em>augment</em> 提高，增大，加强</p><p><em>glimmer</em> 微弱的迹象，一丝，一线</p><p><em>substitute</em> 替代品；同···代替</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>印度现在发展的如何，我不太了解，只知道我们平时都是在笑它恒河水如何能够“强身健体”，笑它“干净又卫生”😂</p></blockquote>]]></content>

So I left the house, went to a new coffee shop, sat by a sunny window, and made lots of progress on editing the second chapter of the book.</p><p><em>And it felt fun.</em></p><p>So, next time you’re feeling a bit meh about something, take 5 seconds to ask: <em>what would this look like if it was an adventure?</em> That simple reframing could make your whole day more enjoyable.</p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Ali xx</p><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p>disengage 脱离</p><p>Definitely 肯定，绝对</p><p>pyjamas 睡衣</p><p>hunch 预感，直觉，驼背</p><p>reframing 重构</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者曾在家中写书时觉得十分无聊，突然想到将其当成冒险活动一样对待，就不再觉得无趣，反而动力十足。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>个人感觉就是告诉我们在做某些比较艰难或无趣的工作时，可以将其看做是打游戏升级（冒险活动），这样就会动力十足，效率MAX，从而学会享受工作。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

If you’re not familiar with him, Will Guidara is former owner of some of New York’s most expensive restaurants, including one which was recently named the best restaurant in the world.</p><p>The book’s packed full of interesting ideas, but his approach to creativity was something that particularly stood out to me.</p><p>Now, I’ve never really considered myself to be a creative person – I’ve got friends who can seemingly pull amazing ideas out of thin air, whereas I feel like I’ve got to rely heavily on external sources of inspiration. Like, when I sit down to come up with ideas for something I usually turn to things I’ve read, watched, or listened to so I can gradually piece things together and connect the dots in my own way.</p><p>Creativity just isn’t a spontaenous process for me, which is how I’ve always thought it should be.</p><p>But, in the book, Will talks about creativity as something that’s far more systematic than spontaneous. Basically, he says that the people we think are most creative are the ones that have a <em>systematic process</em> behind that creativity.</p><p>This was a very liberating idea because I’ve had this limiting belief for some time that ‘I’m not a very creative person’. But, if we think of creativity as being a systematic process, rather than a spontaneous process, then this isn’t true at all.</p><p>For example, I’ve got systematic processes for my creativity when it comes to making YouTube videos (which we teach our students in the <a href="https://academy.aliabdaal.com/">Part-Time YouTuber Academy</a> – enrolment closes on Friday 17 March btw 😉) and systematic processes for thinking of business ideas (which involves journalling and asking myself various questions).</p><p>And although these processes don’t look that creative, they’re responsible for the consistent creative output that has helped me to create hundreds of videos and grow a multi-million dollar business over the last few years.</p><p>So, the takeaway here is that creativity is an active process.</p><p>As William Faulkner once said, ‘I only write when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes at nine every morning.’</p><p>The point is, the only way to be properly creative is to show up and put in the work.</p><p>So, if you’re ever held back by the limiting belief that ‘you’re not creative enough to do X’, realise that the way you become more creative is to stop waiting for inspiration to strike and start taking action.</p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Ali xx</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>inspiration</em> 鼓舞，启示，灵感</p><p><em>spontaenous</em> 自发的</p><p><em>liberate</em> 解放</p><p><em>consistent</em> 持续，一致，连贯</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者曾经陷入误区，即没有足够的灵感来临时，不知如何去创作，他觉得自己不是一个有创作能力的人，陷入自我怀疑状态。在读了某本书后幡然醒悟，不再受其局限。</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>行胜于言，与其在此焦虑，不如马上行动，不要等待机会，而在行动中创造机会。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

And we got talking about ‘the return-on-investment (ROI) on free work’.</p><p>See, most people make the mistake of <strong>charging too early</strong> when they’re breaking into a new industry (eg as a copywriter or video editor).</p><p>That builds a barrier: ‘you have to pay $X to work with me’. So they end up competing with thousands of other freelancers on Upwork or Fiverr, and 99% of potential clients never see their work.</p><p>The smarter alternative is to work for free – but be strategic about it.</p><p>Draw up a list of dream collaborators.</p><p>Then send out sample blogs, video edits, or pieces of graphic design you’ve made <strong>especially for them,</strong> for free. Post it on social media as well, saying ‘check out this cool thing I made for X’.</p><p>If an influential person sees work you did for them and really likes it, I almost guarantee they’ll offer to pay for more.</p><iframe id="twitter-widget-0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="custom-cursor-default-hover" title="Twitter Tweet" src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfdGltZWxpbmVfbGlzdCI6eyJidWNrZXQiOltdLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2ZvbGxvd2VyX2NvdW50X3N1bnNldCI6eyJidWNrZXQiOnRydWUsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ0ZndfdHdlZXRfZWRpdF9iYWNrZW5kIjp7ImJ1Y2tldCI6Im9uIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd19yZWZzcmNfc2Vzc2lvbiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJvbiIsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ0ZndfbWl4ZWRfbWVkaWFfMTU4OTciOnsiYnVja2V0IjoidHJlYXRtZW50IiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd19leHBlcmltZW50c19jb29raWVfZXhwaXJhdGlvbiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOjEyMDk2MDAsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9LCJ0ZndfZHVwbGljYXRlX3NjcmliZXNfdG9fc2V0dGluZ3MiOnsiYnVja2V0Ijoib24iLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3ZpZGVvX2hsc19keW5hbWljX21hbmlmZXN0c18xNTA4MiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJ0cnVlX2JpdHJhdGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2xlZ2FjeV90aW1lbGluZV9zdW5zZXQiOnsiYnVja2V0Ijp0cnVlLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VkaXRfZnJvbnRlbmQiOnsiYnVja2V0Ijoib24iLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfX0%3D&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1402415296338595842&amp;lang=en-gb&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Faliabdaal.com%2Fnewsletter%2Fshould-you-work-for-free%2F&amp;sessionId=22b6230179dd9012ceea8626f82107fa1017702b&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=aaf4084522e3a%3A1674595607486&amp;width=550px" data-tweet-id="1402415296338595842" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: -0.32px; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(231, 231, 231); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 761px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;"></iframe><p>If a video editor turned one of my full-length videos into an amazing YouTube Short for free, I’d <strong>throw money</strong> at them to produce more.</p><p>But most people don’t realise this.</p><p>So they send generic emails saying ‘hi, I’d like to work with you, my rate is X’.

are nursery rhymes both a blessing for parents and important to children?"></a><strong>Why are nursery rhymes both a blessing for parents and important to children?</strong></h1><hr><p>As evening sets in and parents put their children to bed, many resort to singing nursery rhymes to lull them off to sleep.</p><p>But nursery rhymes are not just a good way of calming your kids, they also teach them a few things.</p><p>Dr Georgina Nutton, an early childhood education lecturer at Charles Darwin University (CDU), said nursery rhymes provided children with the building blocks of their first language.</p><p>She said the rhyming couplets found in songs like This Old Man, Hey Diddle Diddle and Humpty Dumpty taught children patterns in language that develop as they grow.</p><p>“When they get to about [age] two or three, you will say something and your child will come up with every obscene rhyming word that goes with what you’ve said,” Dr Nutton said.</p><p>“It’s just a playful use of language but it tells us that the child understands those phonemic patterns.”</p><p><strong>‘Like filling a piggy bank’</strong></p><p>CDU special education lecturer and speech pathologist Dr Bea Staley said nursery rhymes were certainly not integral to a child’s development, but they did help.</p><p>“You can get by without them, but why would you?</p><p>“From a language standpoint, little kids are a like a piggy bank and you’ve got to keep putting words in because when they get to school, school is going to start withdrawing that cash.</p><p>“The more words they’ve got at that point, the better they tend to do at school.”</p><p>She said it was the repetitive nature of most nursery rhymes that taught children how sounds and sentences worked.</p><p>“Really, they are one of the best predictors of future reading proficiency when kids get to school,” she said.</p><p>“And when you see that phenomena where kids just magically learn to read, it’s those kids who usually have lots of experience with things like nursery rhymes, rhyme play and sound play.”</p><p><strong>Can I make up my own rhymes?</strong></p><p>From a speech pathology point of view, Dr Staley said parents making up their own songs or rhymes had its benefits but they needed to show some caution.</p><p>“Traditional nursery rhymes already have the rhyme and the cadence, the things that children need,” she said.</p><p>“If you’re making up your own nursery rhymes you might be undoing some of that, but I still think it would be a good language activity.”</p><p>Dr Nutton said from an early childhood education perspective, growing children needed a growing vocabulary and made-up songs could offer that.</p><p>“There’s a lot of fun that you can have making up silly songs and rhyming as your child gets older,” she said.</p><p>“[But] if you’re enjoying what you’re doing and you’re having fun with it, that’s what they will learn, rather than the specific content of the rhyme or the song.”</p><p><strong>Any song will do</strong></p><p>While rhymes, whether traditional or made up, may be the best for developing language and filling your child’s vocabulary piggy bank, Dr Nutton said there was nothing wrong with simply singing your child to sleep.</p><p>“I wouldn’t suggest too much heavy metal at bed time, but anything that’s really familiar to you and has a bit of a rhythm to it can be used.</p><p>“While you’re singing your tone will drop a little and you’ll be using nice rhythmic patterns, but there’s also a level of how familiar your child is with your particular voice.</p><p>“From before they’re born they’re hearing your voice so that creates a sense of security and familiarity.”</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink"

Here’s what they found.</p><p>Do you believe that the earlier you go to bed and the earlier you get up, the healthier, happier, and more productive you’ll be? Many people do, and many websites, including this one, offer lots of advice about how to be a morning person and why it’s so important to be one.</p><p>Well, maybe it isn’t so important after all. A new study from Harvard traced the sleep habits of 61 students over 30 days and correlated those habits with the students’ grades. It found that students who got regular sleep–that is, who went to bed and woke up about the same time every day–did better in school than those who slept irregular hours. You might expect that much to be true, but here are some more surprising findings:</p><ol><li>You don’t have to wake up at 5 a.m. after all.</li></ol><p>The study did find that students were better off if they slept during “nighttime” hours, but it defined those hours as 10 pm to 10 am. As Charles Czeisler, M.D., chief of the Sleep and Circadian Disorders Division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital told CNN, “The results of this study are not suggesting everybody has to be a goody-two-shoes. So if you go to bed at 2 and get up at 9, that’s fine. You just have to consistently do the same thing.”</p><ol start="2"><li>Getting enough sleep won’t help you if you sleep irregular hours.</li></ol><p>The researchers expected to find that the irregular sleepers who stayed up till all hours were sleeping fewer hours than their regular-sleeping counterparts. But no–both groups were sleeping about the same number of hours in total because the irregular sleepers were napping during the day. Their grades still suffered, proving what most of us know by instinct: A nap can be nice but it’s no replacement for a good night’s sleep.</p><ol start="3"><li>Sleeping irregular hours can make you fat.</li></ol><p>Irregular sleepers had delayed circadian rhythms compared to regular sleepers. Both phenomena have been shown to be related to weight gain in earlier studies, the researchers note. If that information isn’t enough to make you stop pulling all-nighters, I don’t know what is.</p><ol start="4"><li>Irregular sleep could be a symptom of something else.</li></ol><p>One thing the study didn’t do is measure the things that might cause someone to become an irregular sleeper, and how they might affect academic performance. For example, if you’re someone who goes to bed at precisely 10 pm every night and wakes up at precisely 5 am every morning, chances are you’re a highly disciplined sort, which means you might also have the discipline to get all your homework done early. Conversely, irregular sleep can be a symptom of depression, and depression could certainly affect one’s academic performance.</p><p>More study is needed to better understand these factors, the researchers say. In the meantime, if you’re a late riser stop beating yourself up about it. Concentrate on getting up at the same late hour every morning instead.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>track</em> 一首歌曲；追踪，记录···的进展</p><p><em>morning person</em> 早起的人，感觉在早晨精力充沛的人</p><p><em>trace</em> 找到，发现，查出；查明···的起因</p><p><em>correlate</em> 相关的</p><p><em>better off</em> 境况更好；经济状况较以前好</p><p><em>M.D.</em> 医学博士（缩写）</p><p><em>circadian</em> 昼夜的，约24小时的</p><p><em>goody-two-shoes</em> 形容一个人过分守规矩，有点虚伪或装模作样</p><p><em>counterpart</em> 相反的，对立的</p><p><em>nap</em> 小睡，打盹</p><p><em>instinct</em> 直觉</p><p><em>rhythm</em> 规律，韵律</p><p><em>phenomenon</em> 现象；非凡的人（或事物）；奇才；奇迹</p><p><em>pull all-nighter</em> 通宵活动；通宵学习</p><p><em>the chances are</em> 很有可能</p><p><em>discipline</em> 自律，守规矩的，训练有素的</p><p><em>conversely</em> 相反地，反过来</p><p><em>beat yourself up</em>  怪罪自己，苛求自己</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>规律睡眠比睡眠时间的堆叠更重要。原来即使天天熬夜，只要你是固定时间入睡和固定时间起床，反而危害不大；相反间歇性的熬夜对身体危害更大，这是没想到的，哈哈。anyway，早睡早起，养成良好的睡眠习惯总是不错的。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

It broke multiple records as it did so.</p><p>The film scored $38.5 million (RMB266 million) over the Friday to Sunday weekend, according to data from consultancy Artisan Gateway. However, it opened on Thursday, a day earlier than is the norm in China, and has accumulated $55.2 million over the opening four-day frame.</p><p>The film is based on IP that is well-known to a generation of comic book fans and TV audiences in China (early middle-aged men were reported to have been particularly interested) and has already proved a hit in other parts of Asia. (Comscore estimates that the film has grossed $211 million worldwide.)</p><p>Approval went wider than a single demographic segment, however. “The First Slam Dunk” received strong acclaim across China’s major movie rating platforms, including a 9.2 out of 10 score from Douban users and 9.4 out of 10 on ticketing platforms Maoyan and Taopiaopiao.</p><p>The film played especially well at Imax venues, occupying 731 Imax screens in China. Imax China reported that the film earned RMB38 million ($5.51 million) over four days. That was the biggest opening for any foreign animation title on Imax and for any Japanese film on Imax in China. Imax screens also accounted for 10% of the China box office weekend total.</p><p>Artisan Gateway figures show “The First Slam Dunk” enjoyed a nearly 74% share of the total China box office market on a (Friday to Sunday) weekend worth $52.3 million.</p><p>The high-scoring newcomer easily edged aside Jackie Chan vehicle “Ride On,” which had led the China box office for the two previous weekends. “Ride On” earned $2.9 million over the weekend for a 19-day cumulative of $28.3 million.</p><p>“Hachiko,” a Chinese retelling of a Japanese dog-human loyalty tale, earned $2.4 million on its fourth weekend of release. That helped it to a cumulative of $39.4 million since releasing on March 31.</p><p>“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” held on to fourth place. It earned $1.8 million in its third weekend frame. While the film powered to an $877 million global cumulative, just $19.4 million of that has come from China.</p><p>Fifth place over the weekend was another Japanese animation, “Suzume.” It earned $1.7 million for a cumulative of $112 million since releasing in China on March 24.</p><p>The latest weekend lifted the year-to-date box office total in China to $2.58 billion, according to Artisan Gateway’s calculation. That is 23% ahead of a COVID-affected 2022 and 15% behind the same point in 2019.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>animated</em> 活跃的，生气勃勃的；动画的，动画制作的</p><p><em>feature film</em> 角色，特征，特点，功能；故事片，正片</p><p><em>slam dunk</em> 灌篮，扣篮</p><p><em>dominate</em> 占主导地位，占支配地位，拥有优势，最明显的</p><p><em>box office</em> 售票处，票房；受欢迎，卖座</p><p><em>consultancy</em> 咨询公司；咨询服务</p><p><em>accumulate</em> 积累</p><p><em>comic book</em> 漫画杂志，连环画杂志</p><p><em>hit</em> 成功，很受欢迎的人或事物</p><p><em>gross</em> 总收入为，获得···毛利</p><p><em>edge aside</em> 在竞争中轻松击败或超越对手</p><p><em>vehicle</em> 为某个表演者特意制作的电影或节目</p><p><em>cumulative</em> 累积的</p><p><em>loyalty</em> 忠诚，忠实</p><p><em>tale</em> 故事，历险记</p></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>我先来，TV版和漫画都没看过，有机会可以看下😳</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Others said the app provided a platform to launch small businesses or discuss topics such as eldercare and mental health. </p><p>TikTok covered the group’s travel and accommodation expenses. The company bused the influencers on Wednesday to the Capitol grounds, where they gathered on a scenic rooftop to shoot their own videos and stand for journalists’ interviews. </p><p>Later in the day, the influencers met with lawmakers and held a news conference near the Capitol building with Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D., N.Y.) and others.</p><p>“Why the hysteria and the panic and the targeting of TikTok?” asked Mr. Bowman, before suggesting xenophobia against China was at play and Congress should focus instead on addressing broader concerns about social media. “American social-media companies have been used to facilitate harms.”</p><p>After threats of banning the app started during the Trump administration, the company has spent recent years building a U.S.-based security apparatus to wall off U.S. user data and give officials the ability to inspect the computer code that recommends videos to users.</p><p>TikTok stars were a crucial factor in the company’s successful effort to fight off a proposed ban during the Trump years. Whether they will have the same influence this time around remains to be seen.</p><p>“I’m aware of the popularity of the platform. I’m not oblivious,” said Rep.

基本概念</h2><blockquote><p>进程是操作系统进行资源分配的基本单位，而线程是操作系统进行调度的基本单位，即CPU分配时间的单位</p></blockquote><p>进程就是应用程序在内存中分配的空间，也就是正在运行的程序，各个进程之间互不干扰。同时进程保存着程序每一个时刻运行的状态</p><blockquote><p>此时，CPU采用时间片轮转的方式运行进程：CPU为每个进程分配一个时间段，称作它的时间片。如果在时间片结束时进程还在运行，则暂停这个进程的运行，并且CPU分配给另一个进程（这个过程叫做<strong>上下文切换</strong>）。如果进程在时间片结束前阻塞或结束，则CPU立即进行切换，不用等待时间片用完<br>当进程暂停时，它会保存当前进程的状态（进程标识，进程使用的资源等），在下一次切换回来时根据之前保存的状态进行恢复，接着继续执行</p></blockquote><p>一个进程就包含了多个线程，每个线程负责一个单独的子任务</p><blockquote><p>进程让操作系统的并发性成为了可能，而线程让进程内部的并发成为了可能</p></blockquote><p>进程与线程的区别：</p><ul><li>进程单独占有各自的内存空间，有内存隔离，数据共享过程复杂但同步简单；线程在其对应的进程中共享内存空间，数据共享简单但同步复杂</li><li>因为进程之间互不干扰，故不容易影响主程序的稳定性；而某个线程崩溃可能影响到整个进程崩溃，可靠性低</li><li>因进程独占内存空间，故创建和销毁开销大（重量级）；线程开销小（轻量级）</li></ul><h2 id="1-2-上下文切换"><a href="#1-2-上下文切换" class="headerlink" title="1.2 上下文切换"></a>1.2 上下文切换</h2><blockquote><p>CPU从一个进程&#x2F;线程切换到另一个进程&#x2F;线程</p></blockquote><p>上下文：某一时间点CPU寄存器和程序计数器中的内容</p><p>CPU通过为每个线程分配CPU时间片来实现多线程机制。CPU通过时间片分配算法来循环执行任务，当前任务执行一个时间片后会切换到下一个任务。</p><p>但是，在切换前会保存上一个任务的状态，以便下次切换回这个任务时，可以再加载这个任务的状态。所以任务从保存到再加载的过程就是一次上下文切换。</p><p>上下文切换通常是计算密集型的，意味着此操作会<strong>消耗大量的 CPU 时间，故线程也不是越多越好</strong>。所以减少系统中上下文切换次数，可以提升多线程性能</p><h1 id="二、多线程实现"><a href="#二、多线程实现" class="headerlink" title="二、多线程实现"></a>二、多线程实现</h1><h2 id="2-1-继承Thread类"><a href="#2-1-继承Thread类"

线程中断</h3><blockquote><p>线程中断机制是一种协作机制。需要注意，通过中断操作并不能直接终止一个线程，而是通知需要被中断的线程自行处理<br>在线程中断机制里，当其他线程通知需要被中断的线程后，线程中断的状态被设置为true，但是具体被要求中断的线程要怎么处理，完全由被中断线程自己而定，可以在合适的时间处理中断请求，也可以完全不处理继续执行下去</p></blockquote><ul><li><code>Thread.interrupt()</code>：中断线程。这里的中断线程并不会立即停止线程，而是设置线程的中断状态为true（默认是flase）</li><li><code>Thread.interrupted()</code>: 测试当前线程是否被中断。线程的中断状态受这个方法的影响，意思是调用一次使线程中断状态设置为true，连续调用两次会使得这个线程的中断状态重新转为false</li><li><code>Thread.isInterrupted()</code>: 测试当前线程是否被中断。与上面方法不同的是调用这个方法并不会影响线程的中断状态</li></ul><h1 id="五、Java线程间的通信"><a

href="#Java虚拟机栈" class="headerlink" title="Java虚拟机栈"></a>Java虚拟机栈</h4><ul><li><p>Java虚拟机栈（Java Virtual Machine Stack）是线程私有的，它的生命周期与线程相同。虚拟机栈描述的是Java方法执行的线程内存模型：每个方法被执行的时候，Java虚拟机都会同步创建一个栈帧（Stack Frame）用于存储局部变量表、操作数栈、动态连接、方法出口等信息。每一个方法被调用直至执行完毕的过程，就对应着一个栈帧在虚拟机栈中从入栈到出栈的过程</p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/21/14169af4f06dae4e.png" alt="image-20220111104206931" style="zoom:80%;" /></li><li><p>如果线程请求的栈深度大于虚拟机所允许的深度，将抛出<code>StackOverflowError</code>异常</p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/21/a9aba57558d8726e.png" alt="image-20220111104648533" style="zoom:80%;" /></li><li><p>如果Java虚拟机栈容量可以动态扩展，当栈扩展时无法申请到足够的内存会抛出<code>OutOfMemoryError</code>异常</p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/21/df21359fa1b737ac.png" alt="image-20220111105125875" style="zoom:80%;" /></li></ul><h4 id="本地方法栈"><a href="#本地方法栈" class="headerlink" title="本地方法栈"></a>本地方法栈</h4><ul><li>与Java虚拟机栈类似，只不过服务对象不一样，本地方法栈为虚拟机使用到的本地方法服务，Java虚拟机栈为虚拟机执行Java方法（字节码）服务</li></ul><h4 id="Java堆"><a href="#Java堆" class="headerlink" title="Java堆"></a>Java堆</h4><ul><li>对于Java应用程序来说，Java堆（Java Heap）是虚拟机所管理的内存中<strong>最大</strong>的一块。Java堆是被所有<strong>线程共享</strong>的一块内存区域，在虚拟机启动时创建。此内存区域的唯一目的就是存放对象实例，Java世界里“几乎”所有的对象实例都在这里分配内存</li><li>当堆内存没有足够空间给对象实例分配内存并且堆内存无法扩展时都会抛出OOM异常</li></ul><h4 id="方法区"><a href="#方法区" class="headerlink" title="方法区"></a>方法区</h4><ul><li>方法区与Java堆类似，也是各个线程共享的区域，它用于存储已被虚拟机加载的类型信息、常量、静态变量、即时编译器编译后的代码缓存等数据</li><li>通常用别名“非堆”来与Java堆做区分</li><li>当方法区没有足够空间满足内存分配要求时，也会抛出OOM异常</li></ul><h4 id="运行时常量池"><a href="#运行时常量池" class="headerlink" title="运行时常量池"></a>运行时常量池</h4><ul><li>运行时常量池是方法区的一部分，用于存放编译期生成的各种字面量与符号引用</li><li>受方法区内存限制，当常量池无法再申请到内存时会抛出OOM异常</li></ul><h4 id="直接内存"><a href="#直接内存" class="headerlink" title="直接内存"></a>直接内存</h4><ul><li>直接内存并不是运行时数据区的一部分，但它受总内存限制，也可能会出现OOM异常</li></ul><h3 id="HotSpot虚拟机对象探秘"><a href="#HotSpot虚拟机对象探秘" class="headerlink"

alt="image-20211227162109009"></p></li></ul><h4 id="对象的内存布局"><a href="#对象的内存布局" class="headerlink" title="对象的内存布局"></a>对象的内存布局</h4><p>在HotSpot虚拟机里，对象在堆内存中的存储布局可以划分为三个部分：对象头（Header）、实例数据（Instance Data）和对齐填充（Padding）</p><ul><li><p>对象头</p><ul><li>存储对象自身运行时数据（Mark Word），如哈希码（HashCode）、GC分代年龄、锁状态标志、线程持有的锁、偏向线程ID、偏向时间戳等</li><li>类型指针（对象指向其类型元数据的指针）</li></ul></li><li><p>实例数据</p><ul><li>对象真正存储的有效信息，即代码中的各类型字段内容</li></ul></li><li><p>对齐填充</p><ul><li>由于HotSpot虚拟机的自动内存管理系统要求对象起始地址必须是8字节的整数倍，即任何对象大小都是8字节的整数倍，故实例数据部分没有对齐的话需要对齐填充来充当占位符补全</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/21/de4be038a42b2f22.png" alt="image-20220109214344338"></p><h4 id="对象的访问定位"><a href="#对象的访问定位" class="headerlink" title="对象的访问定位"></a>对象的访问定位</h4><p>Java程序会通过栈上的reference（一个指向对象的引用）数据来操作堆上的具体对象，具体的访问方式由虚拟机实现。</p><p>主流访问方式主要有两种：</p><ul><li><p>句柄</p><p><img

While some might revel in the crowds, parties, pomp and ceremony, others will do everything they can to avoid the occasion.</p><p>BBC News spoke to four people who will not be watching.</p><p><strong>‘It’s a huge waste of public money’</strong></p><p>Oli in Stroud will not be following the events either.</p><p>“I think it’s a huge waste of public money,” says the 51-year-old midwife.</p><p>For Oli, a hereditary head of state is elitist and undemocratic.</p><p>“You’ve got this tiny little band of elite at the top of our society that are thriving and then everybody else is scrabbling around trying to make ends meet and put food on the table,” she says.</p><p>As an NHS worker, she says taxpayers’ money could be better spent.</p><p>“The Royal Family have their own personal wealth and yet we, the taxpayers, are having to fund this parade in the middle of a financial crisis,” she says.</p><p>Instead of watching, she will be on shift at hospital helping to deliver babies.</p><p><strong>‘I’d rather have a lie-in and eat some doughnuts’</strong></p><p>Tarek Ahmed says he does not “care enough to watch for hours”.</p><p>“I’d rather have a lie-in and eat some doughnuts”, explains the 21-year-old marketing executive from Kent.</p><p>Tarek says he has not decided whether or not he supports the Royal Family.</p><p>“If they make the country money, happy days. That means more money for things like the NHS and education. But if that’s not the case then I don’t want them. I don’t know the answer,” he says.</p><p>A YouGov poll commissioned by the BBC’s Panorama programme suggests broad support for keeping the monarchy, with 58% preferring it to an elected head of state - which was supported by 26%.</p><p>Tarek plans to spend Saturday morning watching the new Avatar film with his family instead. But he might catch a quick round-up of the Coronation afterwards.</p><p>“I’ll probably look at highlights with the moment the crown goes on his head - that’s a bit of history.”</p><p>Despite his views on the Coronation, Tarek is looking forward to the bank holiday.</p><p>“We get an extra day off and the entire country deserves that”, he says.</p><p><strong>‘I don’t feel like Charles deserves to be King’</strong></p><p>Joana Firmino says she does not like King Charles and does not want to see him being crowned.</p><p>“I don’t think he’s going to be a good role model,” says the 21-year-old waitress from Kent.</p><p>Joana was a fan of Queen Elizabeth II and was “extremely upset” when she passed away.</p><p>But she worries King Charles may “not make good decisions” because of his troubled relationship with his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales. She says his son Prince William would be “a way better king”.</p><p>“If it was William being crowned, I would definitely watch. But I don’t want to spend hours watching someone I don’t really like getting crowned as King when I believe he doesn’t deserve to be,” she says.</p><p>Instead, Joana will be jetting off on holiday to the Philippines.</p><p>“I’m not going to be wasting my time. I’ll be enjoying the sunny weather and tropical beaches,” she adds.</p><p><strong>‘I’ll be busy working on Eurovision’</strong></p><p>Luke Dudley is working as a spotlight operator at the Eurovision Song Contest and says “back-to-back” rehearsals means he cannot watch the ceremony.</p><p>“It’s a very tightly packed schedule which we’ve been religiously sticking to,” he explains.</p><p>The 27-year-old from Manchester works in the lighting department, providing the key light for artists and presenters on the stage.</p><p>Luke is disappointed to be missing “a momentous period in our history”.</p><p>“Friends and family have parties planned, so it’s a massive shame. I love the pomp, ceremony and spectacle of it all,” he says.</p><p>Despite Luke not being able to participate in the coronation parties, he says he “couldn’t pass on an opportunity like Eurovision”.</p><p>“I couldn’t be more excited.

Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter"></a>Do You Really Need 8 Hours of Sleep Every Night? Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter</h1><h1 id="From-TED"><a href="#From-TED" class="headerlink" title="From: TED"></a>From: TED</h1><hr><p>Sleep is so important.</p><p>We need it to live.</p><p>And when we can’t sleep, we’re desperate for help.</p><p>But lately, our fascination with sleep feels as if it’s taken on an urgency.</p><p>Do a quick internet search for sleep and you’ll find a slew of articles about how to make your sleep perfect.</p><p>New gadgets, fancy alarm clocks, stay away from blue light.</p><p>There are lots of services, products and advice columns that tell us we’re sleeping wrong.</p><p>Not enough, not quality sleep, wrong position.</p><p>Even worse, you might find scary messaging claiming that if you’re not sleeping right, your life is going to be shorter. You’re going to get all kinds of diseases.</p><p>One of the biggest worries we have about our sleep is that we’re not getting enough and that anything less than seven hours a night means that we’re doomed to bad health, everything from high blood pressure to Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>But there are two flaws with this kind of messaging.</p><p>The first flaw is that it’s not completely accurate.</p><p>Seven to eight hours of sleep, while recommended for adults, is just an average.</p><p>And while messages have to be simplified for health communication to the public, sometimes important nuances get lost.</p><p>So yes, it’s true that not getting enough sleep in the long term is associated with health problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression.</p><p>But fixating solely on seven to eight hours ignores the fact that there’s a range of sleep that people need.</p><p>The duration of a good night’s sleep can be different for different people.</p><p>Some adults need eight, but some are just fine on six.</p><p>The second flaw with this kind of doomsday messaging is that it can be counterproductive, especially for people who do have trouble sleeping.</p><p>For instance, in 2019, it was estimated that 21 percent of adults in the US were wearing sleep tracking devices. And that number is probably growing.</p><p>And I get it.</p><p>It’s fascinating to see how much sleep you’ve gotten each night and to know what part of your night was spent in deep sleep or dreaming.</p><p>But having all of that sleep data is causing some people to become obsessed with it so much so that it’s leading to a condition some called orthosomnia - a preoccupation with the constant need to achieve perfect sleep.</p><p>And this condition, ironically, is causing more sleep problems.</p><p>Now orthosomnia might be an extreme example, but the anxiety of not getting enough sleep is keeping some of us up at night.</p><p>So here’s what some experts are saying. Stop fixating on the number because that can lead to unrealistic expectations of sleep.</p><p>According to Dr. Colleen Carney, a psychologist and the head of the Ryerson University Sleep Lab, the basic questions you should ask yourself are:</p><p>Do I feel reasonably well-rested during the day?</p><p>Do I generally sleep through the night without disturbances?</p><p>Or, if I wake, do I fall back asleep easily?</p><p>Can I stay awake through the day without involuntarily falling asleep?</p><p>If your answers are yes to all three, you probably don’t need to worry about your sleep.</p><p>And if you’re struggling with your sleep, instead of buying expensive blue light filters or fancy sleep trackers, try talking with your doctor to make sure there aren’t any medical conditions that need to be explored first.</p><p>Then try evidence-based recommendations laid out by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><p>What’s really cool is that there’s a highly effective therapy - called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I. It doesn’t have any medications involved. And it has a really low failure rate.</p><hr><h2 id="生词记录"><a href="#生词记录" class="headerlink" title="生词记录"></a>生词记录</h2><blockquote><p><em>desperate</em> 非常需要的，（因绝望而）拼命的，不顾一切的</p><p><em>fascination</em>  入迷，着迷</p><p><em>gadget</em> 小装置，小器具</p><p><em>column</em> 列，专栏</p><p><em>scary</em> 吓人的，恐怖的</p><p><em>doomed</em> 注定失败（毁灭，灭亡）的</p><p><em>Alzheimer</em> 老年痴呆</p><p><em>nuances</em> 细微差别</p><p><em>cardiovascular</em> 心血管</p><p><em>depression</em> 抑郁症</p><p><em>diabete</em> 糖尿病</p><p><em>fixate</em> 使固定，使痴迷，依恋</p><p><em>doomsday</em> 世界末日</p><p><em>counterproductive</em> 事与愿违的，适得其反的</p><p><em>preoccupation</em> 当务之急，全神贯注</p><p><em>ironically</em>  具有讽刺意味地，出乎意料地，令人啼笑皆非地</p><p><em>keep sb up</em> 耽误睡觉</p><p><em>psychologist</em> 心理学家，心理医生</p><p><em>disturbance</em> 干扰，打扰，骚乱，暴乱，暴力事件，障碍，失调</p><p><em>involuntarily</em> 不由自主地，无意识地</p><p><em>insomnia</em> 失眠</p></blockquote><h2 id="文章概述"><a href="#文章概述" class="headerlink" title="文章概述"></a>文章概述</h2><blockquote><p>作者从两个方面指出8小时睡眠理论的错误：</p><ol><li>8小时是平均值，并非所有人都必须有8小时睡眠</li><li>过于追求完美睡眠可能适得其反</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id="个人感悟"><a href="#个人感悟" class="headerlink" title="个人感悟"></a>个人感悟</h2><blockquote><p>看来我的睡眠还是挺不错的，不过最近又开始有熬夜的苗头了，早上起来状态欠佳，亟需调整（<del>立flag</del>）。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

Stop Pressing the Try Harder Button"></a><strong>😓 1. Stop Pressing the Try Harder Button</strong></h3><p>We all fall into the trap of thinking “I’ll just try harder next time” when we fail. But that approach isn’t usually effective.</p><p>Instead, it’s better to build a sustainable system for achieving our goals. That way, we won’t repeatedly fail or push yourself to burnout.</p><p>For example, if you’re a YouTuber and struggling to get your weekly video out on time, don’t just plan to work extra hours in the evening. Consider outsourcing your editing, making shorter videos, or replacing one video per month with a simple vlog.</p><p>Build a system that works for you.</p><h3 id="🔋2-Energisers-vs-Drainers"><a href="#🔋2-Energisers-vs-Drainers" class="headerlink" title="🔋2. Energisers vs Drainers"></a><strong>🔋2. Energisers vs Drainers</strong></h3><p>Next time you have to choose between two options, ask yourself which one will drain you and which one will energise you. Then choose the option that’ll energise you.</p><p>Some examples might include:</p><ul><li>Time with friends &gt; Netflix</li><li>Evening gym sesh &gt; morning gym sesh</li><li>Your dream work &gt; soulless corporate job that pays twice as much.</li></ul><h3 id="🛋️-3-Choose-to-Be-Satisfied"><a href="#🛋️-3-Choose-to-Be-Satisfied" class="headerlink" title="🛋️ 3. Choose to Be Satisfied"></a><strong>🛋️ 3. Choose to Be Satisfied</strong></h3><p>Don’t beat yourself up at the end of the day for not getting enough done. You can just choose to be satisfied with what you did.</p><p>This might sound a bit wishy-washy, but it genuinely works. You can even say to yourself, <em>Well done [insert name here], you wrote 200 words today. Now it’s time to take a break.</em></p><p>Give yourself permission to switch off and get enough rest so that you can perform properly the next day.</p><h3 id="📆-4-Planning-and-Doing-Are-Different-Modes-of-Being"><a href="#📆-4-Planning-and-Doing-Are-Different-Modes-of-Being" class="headerlink" title="📆 4. Planning and Doing Are Different Modes of Being"></a><strong>📆 4. Planning and Doing Are Different Modes of Being</strong></h3><p>Planning is fundamentally different to doing, and both require a totally different headspace.</p><p>So, plan out what you’re going to do at the start of the day. Then for the rest of the day, simply execute on that plan. Never try to <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/the-pilot-the-plane-the-engineer-258332/">plan and do</a> at the same time.</p><p>This is incredibly effective and works on a macro level as well. In 2022, my weeks where I planned everything in advance were much smoother and more productive.</p><h3 id="🌅-5-Wake-Up-at-the-Same-Time-Every-Day"><a href="#🌅-5-Wake-Up-at-the-Same-Time-Every-Day" class="headerlink" title="🌅 5. Wake Up at the Same Time Every Day"></a><strong>🌅 5. Wake Up at the Same Time Every Day</strong></h3><p>One of the best hacks for improving your sleep quality (and overall quality of life) is to wake up at the same time every day.</p><p>Choose a waking time like 7 or 7:30 that’ll let you get plenty of morning sunlight.
